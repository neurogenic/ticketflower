# Chat User App

===================

# TicketFlower Project Info


TicketFlower is a ticketing and workflow system.

## Workflow Functions

NOTE: This is a multi-tenant web site. Authorization for the workflow function requires a user to have the proper system role PLUS the user must be in the proper company.

System roles: 'admin', 'user', 'ticket_admin', 'task_worker', 'workflow_creator'

### General User Pages

Ticket submission functionality for general users in a given company.

- Submit Tickets
- My Tickets
- Ticket Detail

System role: 'user'
Company role: The customer has the option of assigning company roles to restrict access to specific tickets

### Ticket Admin

Access to workflow tickets and tasks. A ticket display will show the associated workflow.

- Tickets
- Ticket Detail
- Tasks
- Task Detail

We will support different options for assigning and tracking tickets, but for starters I think we will automatically give them to the available worker with the shortest list. Later we can think about giving options here. (Also, more advanced ticket tracking and analytics will be added later.)

System role: 'ticket_admin'

### Task Workers

- My Tasks (To execute)
- Task Execution (For manual/Form type tasks)

System role: 'task_worker'

### Workflow Creators

This will be for workflow designers. For now we will build out minimal functionality to upload workflow, task and ticket definitions. Later this will form the heart of the services value proposition.

- Workflow Definitions
- Workflow Definition Detail
- Task Definitions
- Task Definition Detail
- Ticket Definitions
- Ticket Definition Detail

- Workflow Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Task Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Ticket Definition Upload (Create and edit)

System role: 'workflow_creator'

===============

We have done a bit of work on the TicketFlower server assuming the client would be a react SPA with JWT. I want to now update it so it's using Django forms and the base Django authorization.

First I want to understand what changes we need to make to the base code and the users app. We will discuss the other apps later.

**At this point I only want to have discussions. I want to fully understand the options before we start writing any code.**

=========================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! I understand you want to transition from a React SPA with JWT to using Django forms and Django's built-in authentication system. Let's discuss the changes we need to make to the base code and the users app. I'll outline the main areas we need to consider:

1. Authentication System:
   - Remove JWT-related code and dependencies
   - Switch to Django's session-based authentication
   - Update login and logout views

2. User Model:
   - Review the current custom User model for compatibility
   - Ensure it works well with Django's built-in auth system

3. Forms:
   - Create Django forms for user registration, login, and other user-related actions
   - Remove any API-specific serializers

4. Views:
   - Convert API views to regular Django views
   - Implement form handling in views

5. Templates:
   - Create HTML templates for user-related pages (login, registration, profile, etc.)

6. URLs:
   - Update URL patterns to work with new views and templates

7. Middleware and Settings:
   - Review and adjust middleware if necessary
   - Update settings.py to remove REST framework and JWT configurations

8. Permissions:
   - Adapt the current permission system to use Django's built-in permissions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or do you have any specific questions about the transition process?

===========================

Tell me about djanglos built in permission system.

===========================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! Django's built-in permission system is a powerful and flexible way to manage user access to different parts of your application. Here's an overview of Django's permission system:

1. Default Permissions:
   - Django automatically creates four basic permissions for each model: add, change, delete, and view.
   - These are created when you run migrations.

2. Permission Types:
   - Model-level permissions: Control access to actions on entire model classes.
   - Object-level permissions: Allow for more granular control over individual model instances.

3. User-Group-Permission Relationship:
   - Permissions can be assigned to individual users or to groups.
   - Users can belong to multiple groups, inheriting all permissions from those groups.

4. Admin Interface:
   - Permissions can be managed easily through Django's admin interface.

5. Checking Permissions:
   - In views: Using decorators like @permission_required or mixin classes.
   - In templates: Using template tags like {% if perms.app_name.add_model %}.
   - In code: Using methods like user.has_perm('app_name.add_model').

6. Custom Permissions:
   - You can define custom permissions in your models using the permissions attribute in the Meta class.

7. AnonymousUser:
   - Django provides an AnonymousUser class for unauthenticated users, which has very limited permissions.

8. Superuser:
   - A superuser automatically has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.

9. Integration with Authentication:
   - Works seamlessly with Django's authentication system.

10. Third-party Extensions:
    - Many third-party packages extend Django's permission system for more complex scenarios.

This system would replace the JWT-based authentication and custom permission checks you're currently using. It's more tightly integrated with Django's views and forms, making it a good fit for your transition to a more traditional Django application structure.

Would you like me to explain how this might apply to your specific use cases in TicketFlower, such as the 'workflow_creator' role?

==================

In the current system there are two distinct types of roles for the users. The first role is the system role which controls the user's access for actions like creating workflows (workflow creator), executing a task in a workflow (task worker) or submitting a ticket (general user). There's another role called the company role. The company can define these to differentiate which users have access to which tickets, given that a company can define many different types of tickets.

System roles: 'admin', 'user', 'ticket_admin', 'task_worker', 'workflow_creator'
Company roles: (determined by customer company, defaults to something like just 'user')

Please explain how we can fit this in the django permission.

======================

> Coder_Assistant: Excellent question. Django's permission system can be adapted to handle both your system roles and company roles. Here's how we can approach this:

1. System Roles:
   We can implement these using Django's built-in Group model and custom permissions.

   - Create a Group for each system role ('admin', 'user', 'ticket_admin', 'task_worker', 'workflow_creator').
   - Define custom permissions for each role's capabilities.
   - Assign users to these groups based on their system role.

   Example:
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission
   from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
   from django.db import models

   # In your app's models.py
   class WorkflowDefinition(models.Model):
       # ... other fields ...
       pass

   # Create custom permissions
   workflow_creator_permission = Permission.objects.create(
       codename='can_create_workflow',
       name='Can Create Workflow',
       content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(WorkflowDefinition),
   )

   # Create groups and assign permissions
   workflow_creator_group = Group.objects.create(name='workflow_creator')
   workflow_creator_group.permissions.add(workflow_creator_permission)
   ```

2. Company Roles:
   These are more dynamic and specific to each company. We can implement these using a custom model and a custom permission backend.

   ```python
   from django.db import models
   from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model

   class CompanyRole(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       company = models.ForeignKey('Company', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       users = models.ManyToManyField(get_user_model(), related_name='company_roles')

       class Meta:
           unique_together = ['name', 'company']

   class CompanyPermission(models.Model):
       role = models.ForeignKey(CompanyRole, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       codename = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

   # Custom permission backend
   from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

   class CompanyRoleBackend(BaseBackend):
       def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
           if obj and hasattr(obj, 'company'):
               company_roles = user_obj.company_roles.filter(company=obj.company)
               return CompanyPermission.objects.filter(
                   role__in=company_roles,
                   codename=perm
               ).exists()
           return False
   ```

3. Combining Both:
   In your settings.py, include both authentication backends:

   ```python
   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
       'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',  # Default backend for system roles
       'path.to.CompanyRoleBackend',  # Custom backend for company roles
   ]
   ```

4. Usage:
   You can now check permissions using Django's standard methods:

   ```python
   # Check system role
   if user.has_perm('can_create_workflow'):
       # Allow workflow creation

   # Check company role (assuming 'view_sensitive_ticket' is a company permission)
   if user.has_perm('view_sensitive_ticket', ticket_obj):
       # Allow viewing of sensitive ticket
   ```

5. Admin Integration:
   Extend Django's admin to manage these custom roles and permissions easily.

This approach allows you to leverage Django's built-in permission system for system-wide roles while providing the flexibility to handle company-specific roles. It maintains a clear separation between system and company permissions, making it easier to manage and scale.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation or discuss how it would integrate with your existing user model?

====================

I should have mentioned this is a multi-tenant site. Does that change anything? Users should only have access to DB records for the company they are in.

====================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for clarifying that TicketFlower is a multi-tenant application. This is indeed an important factor that affects our approach to permissions and data access. Let's adjust our strategy to accommodate this multi-tenant requirement:

1. Multi-tenancy Implementation:
   The most common approach for multi-tenancy in Django is to use a "shared database with separate schemas" model. In this case, we'll use a company field in all relevant models to separate data.      

2. Adjusting the User Model:
   Ensure your User model has a required ForeignKey to the Company model. This establishes the tenant relationship for each user.

   ```python
   class User(AbstractUser):
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       # ... other fields ...
   ```

3. Middleware for Tenant Isolation:
   Create a middleware to automatically filter querysets based on the user's company:

   ```python
   from django.db.models import Q

   class TenantMiddleware:
       def __init__(self, get_response):
           self.get_response = get_response

       def __call__(self, request):
           if request.user.is_authenticated:
               # Set the current tenant for this request
               request.tenant = request.user.company
           return self.get_response(request)

   # In your models, use a custom manager
   class TenantManager(models.Manager):
       def get_queryset(self):
           if hasattr(self.model, 'company'):
               return super().get_queryset().filter(company=connection.tenant)
           return super().get_queryset()

   # Use this manager in your models
   class SomeModel(models.Model):
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       # ... other fields ...
       objects = TenantManager()
   ```

4. Permissions System:
   We'll still use Django's built-in permissions system, but we need to ensure it respects tenant boundaries:

   a. System Roles:
      These remain largely the same as in the previous explanation, but we'll add a check for the company in the permission backend.

   b. Company Roles:
      These are now even more important as they define permissions within a company's data set.

   ```python
   class CompanyRole(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       users = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='company_roles')

   class CompanyPermission(models.Model):
       role = models.ForeignKey(CompanyRole, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       codename = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

   class TenantAwareBackend(BaseBackend):
       def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
           if not user_obj.is_authenticated:
               return False

           # Check system permissions
           if user_obj.has_perm(perm):
               return True

           # Check company-specific permissions
           if obj and hasattr(obj, 'company') and obj.company == user_obj.company:
               company_roles = user_obj.company_roles.filter(company=user_obj.company)
               return CompanyPermission.objects.filter(
                   role__in=company_roles,
                   codename=perm
               ).exists()

           return False
   ```

5. Views and Forms:
   In your views, you'll need to ensure that users can only access and modify data belonging to their company:

   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin

   class CompanyUserRequiredMixin(UserPassesTestMixin):
       def test_func(self):
           return self.request.user.is_authenticated and self.request.user.company

   class SomeModelListView(CompanyUserRequiredMixin, ListView):
       model = SomeModel

       def get_queryset(self):
           return super().get_queryset().filter(company=self.request.user.company)
   ```

6. Admin Interface:
   Customize the Django admin to respect tenant boundaries:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin

   class TenantAwareModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
       def get_queryset(self, request):
           qs = super().get_queryset(request)
           if request.user.is_superuser:
               return qs
           return qs.filter(company=request.user.company)

       def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
           if not obj.pk:
               obj.company = request.user.company
           super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)
   ```

These adjustments ensure that:
1. Users can only access data within their company.
2. Permissions are checked both at the system level and the company level.
3. The Django admin interface respects company boundaries for non-superusers.

This approach maintains the separation between system roles and company roles while ensuring data isolation between tenants. It leverages Django's built-in systems where possible and extends them where necessary for multi-tenancy.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this multi-tenant approach or discuss how it integrates with your existing setup?

=======================

Please tell me how to best integrate this with the existing setup.

=====================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly. To integrate this multi-tenant approach with your existing setup, we'll need to make several adjustments. I'll outline the steps we should take, focusing on modifying your current code to support multi-tenancy while maintaining the functionality you've already implemented.

1. User Model:
Your existing User model already has a company field, which is good. We just need to ensure it's not nullable:

```python
class User(AbstractUser):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=False)
    # ... other existing fields ...
```

2. Middleware:
Add a new middleware to your project to set the current tenant:

```python
# In a new file, e.g., ticketflower/middleware.py
class TenantMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        if request.user.is_authenticated:
            request.tenant = request.user.company
        return self.get_response(request)

# In settings.py, add this to MIDDLEWARE
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ... existing middleware ...
    'ticketflower.middleware.TenantMiddleware',
]
```

3. Model Managers:
Create a base manager for tenant-aware models:

```python
# In a new file, e.g., ticketflower/managers.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.query import QuerySet

class TenantQuerySet(QuerySet):
    def filter_by_tenant(self, tenant):
        return self.filter(company=tenant)

class TenantManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return TenantQuerySet(self.model, using=self._db)

    def filter_by_tenant(self, tenant):
        return self.get_queryset().filter_by_tenant(tenant)
```

4. Base Model:
Create a base model for all tenant-aware models:

```python
# In ticketflower/models.py
from django.db import models
from .managers import TenantManager

class TenantAwareModel(models.Model):
    company = models.ForeignKey('users.Company', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    objects = TenantManager()

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

5. Update Existing Models:
Modify your existing models to inherit from TenantAwareModel:

```python
# In workflow_design/models.py
from ticketflower.models import TenantAwareModel

class WorkflowDefinition(TenantAwareModel):
    # ... existing fields ...

class TaskDefinition(TenantAwareModel):
    # ... existing fields ...

# Do this for all models that should be tenant-aware
```

6. Views:
Update your views to filter querysets by the current tenant:

```python
# In workflow_design/views.py
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

class TenantAwareView(LoginRequiredMixin):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter_by_tenant(self.request.tenant)

class WorkflowDefinitionListView(TenantAwareView, ListView):
    model = WorkflowDefinition
    # ... other view logic ...

# Update other views similarly
```

7. Forms:
Modify forms to automatically set the company field:

```python
# In workflow_design/forms.py
from django import forms

class TenantAwareModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.request = kwargs.pop('request', None)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def save(self, commit=True):
        instance = super().save(commit=False)
        if self.request and not instance.pk:
            instance.company = self.request.tenant
        if commit:
            instance.save()
        return instance

class WorkflowDefinitionForm(TenantAwareModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = WorkflowDefinition
        fields = ['name', 'description']  # Exclude 'company'

# Update other forms similarly
```

8. Permissions:
Modify your permission checks to include tenant awareness:

```python
# In users/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission

class TenantAwarePermissionBackend:
    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        if not user_obj.is_authenticated:
            return False

        if user_obj.is_superuser:
            return True

        if obj and hasattr(obj, 'company') and obj.company != user_obj.company:
            return False

        return user_obj.user_permissions.filter(codename=perm.split('.')[1]).exists() or \
               user_obj.groups.filter(permissions__codename=perm.split('.')[1]).exists()

# In settings.py
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'users.models.TenantAwarePermissionBackend',
]
```

9. Admin:
Update the admin to respect tenant boundaries:

```python
# In each app's admin.py
from django.contrib import admin

class TenantAwareAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return qs
        return qs.filter(company=request.user.company)

    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
        if not obj.pk:
            obj.company = request.user.company
        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)

@admin.register(WorkflowDefinition)
class WorkflowDefinitionAdmin(TenantAwareAdmin):
    # ... existing admin configuration ...

# Update other admin classes similarly
```

10. Migrations:
After making these changes, you'll need to create and run migrations:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

These changes will integrate multi-tenancy into your existing setup. The key points are:
- All models now have a company field and use a tenant-aware manager.
- Views and forms automatically filter and set the company based on the logged-in user.
- Permissions are checked against the user's company.
- The admin interface respects company boundaries.

Remember to thoroughly test these changes, especially around data access and creation, to ensure proper tenant isolation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this integration process?

=======================

How is this system best managed by ticketflower employees? If they log into the website, they will have to log in as a specific company without big changes, right. 

Please give a short response here.

=======================

> Coder_Assistant: You're right, and this highlights an important consideration. Without significant changes, TicketFlower employees would indeed need to log in as users of specific companies to manage the system. This isn't ideal for cross-company administration.

A better approach would be to create a separate admin interface specifically for TicketFlower employees. This interface would allow them to manage all companies and users without being tied to a specific company. It would require:

1. A separate login system for TicketFlower staff
2. Custom views that aren't restricted by the tenant system
3. Special permissions for TicketFlower employees

This setup would allow proper system-wide management while maintaining the multi-tenant structure for regular users.

===================

There is too much magic here. Is there an alternate multitenant approach. Please answer briefly.
