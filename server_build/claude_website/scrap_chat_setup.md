# Setup

I am starting to work no a new project. I have the following tasks I have been given.

1. Development Environment Setup

   a. Python Environment:
   - Install Python 3.11 or later if not already installed
   - Set up a virtual environment for the server project:
     - Navigate to the ticketflower_server directory
     - Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
     - Activate the virtual environment

   b. Node.js Environment:
   - Install Node.js 18.x LTS or later if not already installed
   - Install yarn package manager globally

   c. Docker:
   - Install Docker Desktop for Windows
   - Ensure Docker is running and accessible from the command line

   d. Visual Studio Code:
   - Install VS Code if not already present
   - Install recommended extensions for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Docker


Status:

a. Python 3.12.2 is installed and so are the server and client directories. I do not have a virtual environment set up

b. Node.js 20.12.0 is installed. I would prefer to use npm with it.

c. Docket is running.

d. Visual studio code is installed and read to go.

I would like help with the missing steps.

===================

Certainly, I'd be happy to help you with the remaining steps. Let's focus on setting up the Python virtual environment and addressing the package manager preference for Node.js.

Let's start with setting up the Python virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the ticketflower_server directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/ticketflower_server
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment named 'venv':
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

After activation, you should see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

Regarding the Node.js environment:

You mentioned that you prefer to use npm instead of yarn. That's perfectly fine. npm comes pre-installed with Node.js, so you don't need to install anything extra. You can skip the step about installing yarn globally.

To verify that npm is installed and working, you can run:
```
npm --version
```

This should display the version of npm installed on your system.

Lastly, for Visual Studio Code, you might want to install the recommended extensions if you haven't already:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for and install the following extensions:
   - Python (by Microsoft)
   - JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly (or the stable version)
   - Docker

These steps should complete your development environment setup. Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or expand upon?

=====================

npm --version gives 10.5.0.

Step 2 involves setting up the git repositories. Those are both set up with except for the .gitignore files for each repository.

In case this is helpful, the tech stack is:

Back End:

- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- JWT
- Python with Type annotations
- Postgres
- Django's built-in TestCase

Front End:

- Typescript
- Vanilla React (including things like use reducer)
- Vite
- Tailwind and css modules
- Jest with React Testing Library

Docker/Server setup:

- Django and Postgres running in separate containers (set up with docker compose)
    - Later we will use a hosted solution for postgres.
    - For dev, I do not want the server docker file to start the django server. I want to be able to start and stop it with a separate command.
- Django server used for initial development.
    - Later with AI assistant we will probably switch to a server like Uvicorn, Django Channels that will support websockets. 
- Vite set up on PC for development.
    - Later static files will be served from the server.
- Environment variables: .env file (with python-dotenv) for dev
    - Likely docker secrets for prod

Dev Machine:

- Windows PC
- VSCode (with debugger usage)

============

Please don't jump ahead of my instructions. I would like to follow the list given to me to make sure nothing unexpected gets left out.

Here is the next step:

Server Project Structure (Django)

a. Install Django and initial dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, install Django, Django REST framework, and other initial dependencies
Create requirements.txt file

b. Create Django project:
Use django-admin to start a new project named 'ticketflower'
Rename the outer ticketflower directory to 'server' for clarity

c. Configure Django settings:
Update settings.py with appropriate configurations for databases, installed apps, etc.
Set up python-dotenv for environment variable management

d. Create initial Django apps:
Create apps for 'users', 'tickets', 'workflows', and 'tasks'

e. Set up Django REST framework:
Add REST framework to INSTALLED_APPS
Configure basic REST framework settings

f. Create a docker-compose.yml file:
Define services for Django and PostgreSQL
Set up volume for PostgreSQL data persistence

g. Commit changes to git repository

However, before we start with this step, I want you to review it and let me know if it looks reasonable, or if we should make any modifications. Please answer briefly.

============

The plan for the Server Project Structure (Django) looks reasonable and well-structured. It covers all the essential steps for setting up a Django project with REST framework and Docker integration. The sequence of steps is logical, starting from installing dependencies, creating the project structure, configuring settings, and ending with Docker setup and version control.

One small suggestion: Consider adding a step to initialize the git repository (if not already done) before the final commit step.

Otherwise, this plan provides a solid foundation for your Django server project. It's comprehensive and follows best practices for Django development.

==================

Git is initialized. Let's get started, one step at a time.

====================



===============

Understood. Let's start with the first step:

3a. Install Django and initial dependencies:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated. You should see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt.

2. Install Django and initial dependencies:
   ```
   pip install django djangorestframework python-dotenv psycopg2-binary
   ```

3. Create a requirements.txt file:
   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

This will install Django, Django REST framework, python-dotenv for environment variable management, and psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL database adapter. It will also create a requirements.txt file with all the installed packages and their versions.

Let me know when you've completed this step, and we'll move on to the next one.

================

Let's move on to step 2.

===============

Certainly, let's proceed with step 3b:

3b. Create Django project:

1. Use django-admin to start a new project named 'ticketflower':
   ```
   django-admin startproject ticketflower
   ```

2. Rename the outer ticketflower directory to 'server' for clarity:
   - Navigate to the parent directory of the newly created 'ticketflower' folder
   - Rename the outer 'ticketflower' directory to 'server'

Your directory structure should now look like this:
```
server/
├── manage.py
└── ticketflower/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── asgi.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

The outer 'server' directory is your project root, and the inner 'ticketflower' directory contains your Django project files.

Let me know when you've completed this step, and we'll move on to the next one.

===================

Ready for step 3c.

c. Configure Django settings:
Update settings.py with appropriate configurations for databases, installed apps, etc.
Set up python-dotenv for environment variable management

However, I don't want you to do this yet. First, read this and let me know what information you need in order to do it. I will guess it'd be helpful if he had more context about what the project actually was.

=================

---

We will be using Postgres for development and production. It looks like database setup is later. Can you infer from the plan more about what they mean here. If you need more detail I can provide it, but I don't want to try to write the entire application now in this one step.

=========================

We have these steps remaining in project setup:

   d. Create initial Django apps:
   - Create apps for 'users', 'tickets', 'workflows', and 'tasks'

   e. Set up Django REST framework: (Completed)
   - Add REST framework to INSTALLED_APPS
   - Configure basic REST framework settings

   f. Create a docker-compose.yml file:
   - Define services for Django and PostgreSQL
   - Set up volume for PostgreSQL data persistence

Before we do these I would like to discuss them.

I am not sure I am happy with the app breakdown. What scope of work is intended in step d? we aren't going to write any code, are we?


========================

You're right to question this, and it's good to discuss the app breakdown before proceeding. Let's clarify the scope of work intended in step d and consider if it's the right approach at this stage.

The scope of work for step d (Create initial Django apps) typically involves:

1. Using Django's `startapp` command to create the basic structure for each app.
2. Adding these apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.
3. Creating initial, empty `models.py`, `views.py`, and `urls.py` files for each app.

At this stage, we wouldn't write any actual application code. It's just setting up the basic structure.

However, you're right to be cautious about this step. Here are some considerations:

1. Premature division: Breaking the project into apps too early can lead to unnecessary complexity or incorrect separation of concerns.

2. Evolving understanding: As the project develops, you might realize a different app structure works better.

3. Overhead: Each app adds a small amount of overhead in terms of files and import statements.

4. Flexibility: Starting with fewer, broader apps can provide more flexibility as you develop the project's architecture.

Given these points, you might consider alternative approaches:

1. Start with a single app (e.g., 'core' or 'main') and split it later as the project structure becomes clearer.

2. Create apps based on major features or bounded contexts as you implement them, rather than pre-defining them.

3. Delay creating any apps until you start implementing models and views, allowing the structure to evolve naturally.

What are your thoughts on this? Would you prefer to start with a simpler structure and evolve it as the project progresses, or do you see benefits in setting up these initial apps now?

=========================

Maybe we should just start with user management? I suspect the rest, which is a bunch of crud pages dealing with tickets and workflows, can be a single app. But we can commit to that later. Would it be fair to just set up the user management? 

I'm still not ready for code. Let's keep discussing.

=======================

Your approach is sensible and demonstrates good project planning. Starting with user management is indeed a common and practical first step in many projects. Here's why this approach is beneficial:

1. User management is often a foundational aspect of many applications.
2. It's typically more isolated from the business logic, making it a good starting point.
3. Setting up authentication early can inform how you structure other parts of your application.

So, let's revise our plan:

1. Create a 'users' app for user management.
2. Leave the rest (tickets, workflows, tasks) for later, potentially as a single app.

This approach allows us to:
- Start with a clear, focused structure
- Delay decisions about the exact breakdown of the business logic
- Provide a foundation for authentication that other parts of the app can build upon

For the 'users' app, we would:
- Create the basic app structure
- Add it to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
- Prepare it for custom user model (if needed)
- Set up basic URL routing

We won't write any actual model or view code yet, just prepare the structure.

As for the remaining business logic (tickets, workflows, tasks), we can create a placeholder name for now, like 'core' or 'ticketing', but delay its actual creation until we start implementing those features.

Does this align better with your vision for the project structure? And you're right to keep discussing before diving into code - it's important to have a clear plan before implementation.

=====================

Here are the first four steps of the high level plan:

1. Project Setup
   - Set up the development environment
   - Initialize Git repositories for both server and client
   - Create basic project structures for Django and React

2. Database and Model Design
   - Set up PostgreSQL in a Docker container
   - Implement the database schema in Django models
   - Create initial migrations

3. Authentication and Authorization
   - Implement JWT authentication in Django
   - Set up user registration and login endpoints
   - Implement company and role-based authorization

4. Core API Development
   - Develop API endpoints for CRUD operations on main entities (tickets, workflows, tasks)
   - Implement business logic for workflow and task management

We are working on step 1.

FYI user management involves these tables: company, user, user_system_roles, user_company_roles, system_roles, company_roles.

I'd prefer to do as little as possible related to application decisions right now. What is the minimum we can do for the apps?
