# TicketFlower Project Info

TicketFlower is a ticketing and workflow system. Our current effort will be on the user management application of our Django server.

## User Management Schema

-- Companies Table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User System Roles (Junction Table)
CREATE TABLE user_system_roles (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role INTEGER REFERENCES system_roles(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_name)
);

-- User Company Roles (Junction Table)
CREATE TABLE user_company_roles (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role  INTEGER REFERENCES company_roles(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_name)
);

-- Company Roles - Managed by company, used for ticket submit permissions
CREATE TABLE company_roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES company(id),
    role_name VARCHAR(100),
    description VARCHAR(255)
    -- add unique constraint on names
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

System roles: 'admin', 'user', 'ticket_admin', 'task_worker', 'workflow_creator'

## User Management Functions

We will start with only two user management functions. More will be added later.

1. **Create Company**: Here a user will sign up a company.
    - Create the company
    - Create the admin users for the company

2. **User Login**: The user logs in.

# Shared Files

/share requirements.txt ticketflower/settings.py ticketflower/urls.py users/models.py users/views.py users/admin.py

===============

I've shared some files and some information about the project. I'd like to get started on user management for the server. So far you can see it's just a stub based on the files I have shared.

I would appreciate brief responses so we don't overload your context length too quickly. I would also like to work one step at a time.

Without writing any code, can you suggest where we should go from here to work on user management.

=================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly. Based on the current state of the project and the user management requirements, here are the next steps we should consider:

1. Update the User model in users/models.py to include all necessary fields from the schema.
2. Create models for Company, SystemRole, and CompanyRole.
3. Implement the create_company view function.
4. Set up user authentication views (login, logout).
5. Create serializers for the models.
6. Implement API endpoints for user management operations.

Which of these would you like to start with?

=====================

Let's start updating the user model.

======================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly. Let's update the User model in the users/models.py file to include all the necessary fields from the schema. I'll prepare the changes for you to review.

<update_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_server/users/models.py</path>
  <content>
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class Company(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class User(AbstractUser):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, blank=True)
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email

class SystemRole(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
    users = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='system_roles')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class CompanyRole(models.Model):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    users = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='company_roles')

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('company', 'name')

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.company.name} - {self.name}"
  </content>
  <mode>replace</mode>
</update_file>

These changes include:
1. Updated User model with required fields
2. Added Company, SystemRole, and CompanyRole models
3. Established relationships between models

Would you like to review these changes or proceed with implementing them?

===============

I have applied the change to the users/models.py file. What dop you suggest next?

========================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly. Let's update the User model in the users/models.py file to include all the necessary fields from the schema. I'll prepare the changes for you to review.

=====================

...

==============

OK, I have successfully run the migrations.

what do you recommend as the next step?

=============

...

================

> Coder_Assistant: Great! Let's start implementing the views for user management. We'll focus on the two main functions you mentioned earlier: creating a company and user login.

First, let's update the users/views.py file:

<update_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_server/users/views.py</path>
  <content>
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
from .models import Company, User
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens import RefreshToken

class CreateCompanyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]

    def post(self, request):
        company_name = request.data.get('company_name')
        admin_email = request.data.get('admin_email')
        admin_password = request.data.get('admin_password')

        if not all([company_name, admin_email, admin_password]):
            return Response({'error': 'Missing required fields'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

        company = Company.objects.create(name=company_name)
        admin_user = User.objects.create_user(
            username=admin_email,
            email=admin_email,
            password=admin_password,
            company=company,
            is_staff=True
        )

        return Response({'message': 'Company and admin user created successfully'}, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)

class UserLoginView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [AllowAny]

    def post(self, request):
        email = request.data.get('email')
        password = request.data.get('password')

        user = authenticate(request, username=email, password=password)

        if user is not None:
            refresh = RefreshToken.for_user(user)
            return Response({
                'refresh': str(refresh),
                'access': str(refresh.access_token),
            })
        else:
            return Response({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}, status=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED)
  </content>
  <mode>replace</mode>
</update_file>

Now, let's update the ticketflower/urls.py file to include these new views:

<update_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_server/ticketflower/urls.py</path>
  <content>
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import TokenRefreshView
from users.views import CreateCompanyView, UserLoginView

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/create-company/', CreateCompanyView.as_view(), name='create_company'),
    path('api/login/', UserLoginView.as_view(), name='user_login'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
  </content>
  <mode>replace</mode>
</update_file>

These changes implement:
1. A CreateCompanyView that creates a new company and an admin user for that company.
2. A UserLoginView that authenticates users and returns JWT tokens.

The next steps could be:
1. Test these new endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.
2. Implement additional user management features (e.g., user registration, password reset).
3. Add more robust error handling and input validation.

Which of these would you like to focus on next?

=========================

I have applied both file updates. I would certainly like to try it out.

Before we get into code, maybe we should discuss testing. What do you suggest?

==================================

> Coder_Assistant: Excellent point. Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of our code. For this project, we can consider several types of testing:

1. Unit Tests: Test individual components (models, views, etc.) in isolation.
2. Integration Tests: Test how different parts of the application work together.
3. API Tests: Test the API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected.

For Django projects, we typically use the built-in Django test framework, which is based on Python's unittest module. Here's a suggested approach:

1. Create a tests.py file in the users app (if it doesn't exist already).
2. Write unit tests for models and views.
3. Write API tests to check the behavior of our endpoints.

Let's start by creating a basic test file. We'll focus on testing the CreateCompanyView and UserLoginView.

<create_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_server/users/tests.py</path>
  <content>
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from rest_framework import status
from .models import Company, User

class UserManagementTests(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.create_company_url = reverse('create_company')
        self.login_url = reverse('user_login')

    def test_create_company(self):
        data = {
            'company_name': 'Test Company',
            'admin_email': 'admin@testcompany.com',
            'admin_password': 'securepassword123'
        }
        response = self.client.post(self.create_company_url, data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        self.assertTrue(Company.objects.filter(name='Test Company').exists())
        self.assertTrue(User.objects.filter(email='admin@testcompany.com').exists())

    def test_user_login(self):
        # First, create a user
        User.objects.create_user(username='testuser@example.com', email='testuser@example.com', password='testpass123')

        # Then, attempt to log in
        data = {
            'email': 'testuser@example.com',
            'password': 'testpass123'
        }
        response = self.client.post(self.login_url, data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
        self.assertIn('access', response.data)
        self.assertIn('refresh', response.data)

    def test_invalid_login(self):
        data = {
            'email': 'nonexistent@example.com',
            'password': 'wrongpassword'
        }
        response = self.client.post(self.login_url, data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED)
  </content>
</create_file>

These tests cover:
1. Creating a company and admin user
2. Successful user login
3. Failed login attempt

To run these tests, you can use the following command:

<smart_terminal>
  <command>python manage.py test users</command>
  <working_directory>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_server</working_directory>
</smart_terminal>

This approach allows us to verify the basic functionality of our views before we start using them in a live environment. As we add more features, we should continue to add corresponding tests.

Would you like to proceed with implementing these tests, or do you have any questions or modifications you'd like to discuss?

=======================

I updated the test file and ran the tests:

```
(venv) PS C:\dev\neurogenic\ticketflower\ticketflower_server> python manage.py test users
Found 3 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.916s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
(venv) PS C:\dev\neurogenic\ticketflower\ticketflower_server>
```

That is success, right?

What do you suggest next?

=====================

Before we continue, tell me how testing works. How does it manage running the tests and resturning the DB to the original state?

======================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! Django's test framework is designed to provide a clean, isolated environment for each test. Here's how it works:

1. Test Database Creation:
   - When you run tests, Django creates a new, temporary test database.
   - This database is separate from your main development database.
   - It's created based on your current database settings and migrations.

2. Test Execution:
   - Each test method runs in its own transaction.
   - Changes made during a test are not committed to the database unless you explicitly tell it to.
   - This isolation ensures that tests don't interfere with each other.

3. Database Reset:
   - After each test method completes, Django rolls back the transaction.
   - This effectively resets the database to its initial state for the next test.

4. Teardown:
   - After all tests have run, Django destroys the temporary test database.
   - Your original development database remains untouched.

5. Fixtures:
   - If you need pre-populated data for your tests, you can use fixtures.
   - Fixtures are loaded at the beginning of a test case and cleared afterwards.

6. Test Client:
   - Django provides a test client that simulates a web browser, allowing you to make requests to your views and check responses.

7. setUp and tearDown:
   - You can define setUp and tearDown methods in your test classes.
   - setUp runs before each test method, allowing you to set up any necessary data or state.
   - tearDown runs after each test method, allowing you to clean up if needed.

This approach ensures that:
- Each test runs in a clean, known state.
- Tests don't affect your development data.
- Tests are repeatable and consistent.

The "Creating test database" and "Destroying test database" messages you saw in the output indicate this process of creating and destroying the temporary test database.

This system allows you to write and run tests freely without worrying about damaging your development data or tests interfering with each other. It's a crucial part of maintaining a reliable test suite as your project grows.

=================================

I think what I would like to do is commit our current work and then get ready for another phase. Before we do that, suggest what we would do next on the server side. Is there more to do with these two basic user management functions or should we go on to implementing the ticket and workflow features?

================================

> Coder_Assistant: Given our current progress with the basic user management functions (company creation and user login), here's a brief overview of what we could do next:

1. Enhance current user management:
   - Implement user registration for non-admin users
   - Add password reset functionality
   - Create user profile view and update capabilities
   - Implement email verification for new users

2. Improve security and robustness:
   - Add more comprehensive input validation
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Enhance error handling and logging

3. Move to ticket and workflow features:
   - Design and implement ticket model
   - Create views for ticket creation, updating, and listing
   - Implement basic workflow model and logic
   - Design API endpoints for ticket and workflow operations

Considering the core functionality of TicketFlower as a ticketing and workflow system, I would recommend moving on to implementing the ticket and workflow features. The current user management functions provide a solid foundation, and we can always come back to enhance them later.

If you agree, the next steps would be:
1. Design the data model for tickets
2. Implement the ticket model in Django
3. Create views and serializers for basic ticket operations
4. Design the initial workflow model

Does this align with your vision for the project's next phase? Or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect?
