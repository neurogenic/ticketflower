This is an overview of the Ticketflower project, a web site for ticket and workflow management.

The main focus of the site will be on using a AI assistant to help set up
workflows and tickets. Later, the AI assistant will also help with setting up and executing autonomous tasks as a part of workflows.

The initial target will be for small businesses to easily set up a ticket system.

This will be an MVP. I want to get it up and running quickly. The emphasis will not be on full features for the workflow management. The
main point will be to illustrate the capabilities of the AI assistant. We of course still want workable functionality.

The initial code we write will actual leave out the functionality of the AI assistant. We will be developing that later. Here we will be
building the ticket and workflow framework the AI assistant will fit into.

## Tech Stack

- Django
- Python with Type annotations
- Postgres
- Django's built-in TestCase

Dev setup:

- Environment variables: .env file (with python-dotenv) for dev
- Windows machine + VSCode
- Postgres is running in a docker container

# Workflow Definition Guide

This guide outlines the components of a workflow definition in the TicketFlower system, including workflows, tasks, transitions, and tickets.

## Workflow Definition

A workflow definition is the top-level object that describes a complete process.

Fields:
- Title: A short, descriptive name for the workflow
- Description: A detailed explanation of the workflow's purpose and function
- External References: JSON array of {Label: String, Desc: String, URI: String} for any external resources
- Fields: JSON schema for the fields in the workflow
- Version: Integer representing the version of this workflow definition
- Status: One of 'DRAFT', 'ACTIVE', 'DEPRECATED' or 'ARCHIVED'
- Display Layout: Django form content to display the workflow

## Task Definition

Tasks are individual steps within a workflow.

Fields:
- Title: A short, descriptive name for the task
- Description: A detailed explanation of what the task involves
- External References: JSON array of {Label: String, Desc: String, URI: String} for any external resources
- Task Type: One of 'FORM', 'SYNC_ACTION', or 'ASYNC_ACTION'
    - 'FORM': Task is manually executed by a task worker by filling out a form.
    - 'SYNC_ACTION': Task is executed by calling an API that returns the task output values.
    - 'ASYNC_ACTION': Task is executed by calling an API that will asynchronously call back with the task output values.
- Input Schema: JSON schema describing the expected input for this task
- Output Schema: JSON schema describing the expected output from this task
- Version: Integer representing the version of this task definition
- Edit Layout: Django form content for editing a task instance (task type = 'FORM')
- Display Layout: Django form content for displaying a task instance
- Action URL: URL for async or sync actions (task type = 'SYNC_ACTION' or 'ASYNC_ACTION')
- Input Transform: JSON describing how to transform input data (task type = 'SYNC_ACTION' or 'ASYNC_ACTION')
- Output Transform: JSON describing how to transform output data (task type = 'SYNC_ACTION')
- Timeout Seconds: Integer for timeout duration (task type = 'SYNC_ACTION')

## Workflow Transitions

Transitions define the flow between tasks in a workflow.

Fields:
- From Task: The task this transition starts from (can be null for starting transitions)
- To Task: The task this transition leads to (can be null for ending transitions)
- To Status: The workflow status to transition to (used when To Task is null)
- Condition: A JSON object describing the condition for this transition
- Priority: Integer for ordering multiple possible transitions

Rules for Transitions:
1. A transition must have either a To Task or a To Status, but not both.
2. If From Task is null, it represents a starting point for the workflow.
3. If To Task is null and To Status is set, it represents an ending point for the workflow.
4. Multiple transitions can come from the same From Task, but they should have different conditions or priorities.
5. The Condition field can be used to specify when this transition should be taken (based on current workflow 'fields' data).
6. Priority determines the order in which conditions are evaluated when multiple transitions are possible.

## Ticket Definition

Ticket definitions describe the structure of tickets that can be created for this workflow.

Fields:
- Title: A short, descriptive name for the ticket type
- Description: A detailed explanation of what this ticket type represents
- External References: JSON array of {Label: String, Desc: String, URI: String} for any external resources
- Fields: JSON schema for the fields passed into the workflow. Should be a subset of the workflow fields. 
- Version: Integer representing the version of this ticket definition
- Company Role Access: Array of strings of company role names required for access to this ticket type. If none are listed, all company users have access
- Edit Layout: Django form content for editing a ticket instance
- Display Layout: Django form content for displaying a ticket instance

## Best Practices

1. Start with a clear understanding of the entire process before defining the workflow.
2. Break down the process into distinct, manageable tasks.
3. Clearly define the input and output for each task.
4. Use meaningful names and descriptions for all components.
5. Consider all possible paths through the workflow, including error conditions and edge cases.
6. Use the condition field in transitions to create dynamic, data-driven workflows.
7. Leverage the priority field in transitions to control the flow when multiple transitions are possible.
8. Design ticket definitions to capture all necessary information for the workflow.
9. Use the company role access field in ticket definitions to control who can interact with different types of tickets.
10. Utilize the layout fields (display_layout, edit_layout) to create user-friendly interfaces for interacting with workflows, tasks, and tickets.

Remember, a well-designed workflow should be clear, efficient, and flexible enough to handle various scenarios within your business process.

==========================

We have just completed working on some upload and display pages for workflow design for the TicketFlower server. Now I want to do some manual tests. In order to do this, I want to create a few workflows that I can update.

First, I would like to you to review the included material, especially the document 'Workflow Definition Guide'. When you have completed that, please ask me any questions you have about the workflows in TicketFlower and on creating workflows.

======================

1. Are there any specific industry or business process types you'd like to focus on for these test workflows?

2. How complex should these test workflows be? Should we include simple linear workflows as well as more complex branching workflows?

3. Do you want to test all task types (FORM, SYNC_ACTION, ASYNC_ACTION) in these workflows?

4. Should we include examples of conditional transitions in the workflows?

5. For ticket definitions, do you want to test various field types and company role access configurations?

6. Are there any specific edge cases or potential issues you'd like to address in these test workflows?

7. How many distinct workflows would you like to create for testing purposes?

=======================

Great questions.

First I should say I am not really worried about doing extensive testing for now. We will brainstorm sample cases to run when we get to that point.

1. No specific cases for now. I really want to get some data in so we can make sure uploads work and then do basic workflow tests once we have that code in place.

2. We will work out desired cases as we go.

3. Right now we will only support FORM task types.

4. We should include some conditional transitions.

5. For company roles, for now we will only do all access (no roles specified)

6. I'm not sure of the answer to that yet. We will generate one teat case at a time, brainstorming as we go.

7. See #6

Before we continue. I would like you to review the templates, keeping a few things in mind:

- I just changes a few field types. I want to make sure the templates will work properly
    - WorkflowTransition conditions - This was changed from TEXT type (a mistake),to JSON
    - TicketDefinition company_role_access - This was changed from JSON type (a mistake) to String Array type
- Check that all fields are displayed on the detail page. In particular, I am not sure all the WorkflowDefinition fields are displayed.

========================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for the clarification. I'll review the templates with those points in mind.

After reviewing the templates, I have the following observations:

1. WorkflowTransition conditions:
   The transition_detail.html template displays the condition field correctly:
   ```html
   <h3>Condition</h3>
   <pre>{{ transition.condition }}</pre>
   ```
   This should work fine with the JSON field type.

2. TicketDefinition company_role_access:
   The ticket_definition_detail.html template displays the company_role_access field correctly:
   ```html
   <h3>Company Role Access</h3>
   <ul>
   {% for role in ticket.company_role_access %}
       <li>{{ role }}</li>
   {% empty %}
       <li>No specific roles defined.</li>
   {% endfor %}
   </ul>
   ```
   This will work correctly with the String Array field type.

3. WorkflowDefinition fields:
   After reviewing the workflow_definition_detail.html template, I noticed that not all fields from the WorkflowDefinition model are displayed. Specifically, the following fields are missing:

   - ext_ref (External References)
   - fields
   - created_by
   - display_layout

   To ensure all fields are displayed, you might want to update the workflow_definition_detail.html template to include these missing fields.

Would you like me to suggest an updated version of the workflow_definition_detail.html template that includes all the WorkflowDefinition fields?

==============

I would like a file edit to update the workflow_definition_detail.html template.

===================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! I'll provide an updated version of the workflow_definition_detail.html template that includes all the WorkflowDefinition fields. Here's the file edit command:

<update_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/workflow_definition_detail.html</path>
  <content>
{% extends "workflow_design/base.html" %}

{% block workflow_design_content %}
    <h2>{{ workflow.title }} (Version {{ workflow.version }})</h2>
    <p>Status: {{ workflow.status }}</p>
    <p>Description: {{ workflow.description }}</p>

    <h3>External References</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for ref in workflow.ext_ref %}
        <li>{{ ref.Label }}: {{ ref.Desc }} - <a href="{{ ref.URI }}">{{ ref.URI }}</a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No external references.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <pre>{{ workflow.fields|pprint }}</pre>

    <h3>Created By</h3>
    <p>{{ workflow.created_by.username }}</p>

    <h3>Created At</h3>
    <p>{{ workflow.created_at }}</p>

    <h3>Updated At</h3>
    <p>{{ workflow.updated_at }}</p>

    <h3>Display Layout</h3>
    <pre>{{ workflow.display_layout }}</pre>

    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for task in tasks %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'task_definition_detail' task.id %}">{{ task.title }}</a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No tasks defined for this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for transition in transitions %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'transition_detail' transition.id %}">
            {% if transition.from_task %}
                {{ transition.from_task.title }} ->
            {% else %}
                Start ->
            {% endif %}
            {% if transition.to_task %}
                {{ transition.to_task.title }}
            {% else %}
                {{ transition.to_status }}
            {% endif %}
        </a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No transitions defined for this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Tickets</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for ticket in tickets %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'ticket_definition_detail' ticket.id %}">{{ ticket.title }}</a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No ticket definitions associated with this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endblock %}
</content>
</update_file>

This updated template now includes all the fields from the WorkflowDefinition model. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Added a section for External References (ext_ref)
2. Added a section for Fields
3. Added Created By information
4. Added Created At and Updated At timestamps
5. Added a section for Display Layout

The template now displays all the information from the WorkflowDefinition model, providing a more comprehensive view of the workflow definition.

====================

Thank you for the update. After reviewing it, I would like to see a version that presents the WorkflowDefinition fields more like status and description rather than with titles like the tasks, transitions and tickets.

==================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! I understand you'd like a more streamlined presentation of the WorkflowDefinition fields. I'll update the template to present these fields in a manner similar to the status and description. Here's the revised file edit command:

<update_file>
  <path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/workflow_definition_detail.html</path>
  <content>
{% extends "workflow_design/base.html" %}

{% block workflow_design_content %}
    <h2>{{ workflow.title }} (Version {{ workflow.version }})</h2>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> {{ workflow.status }}</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> {{ workflow.description }}</p>
    <p><strong>Created By:</strong> {{ workflow.created_by.username }}</p>
    <p><strong>Created At:</strong> {{ workflow.created_at }}</p>
    <p><strong>Updated At:</strong> {{ workflow.updated_at }}</p>

    {% if workflow.ext_ref %}
    <p><strong>External References:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    {% for ref in workflow.ext_ref %}
        <li>{{ ref.Label }}: {{ ref.Desc }} - <a href="{{ ref.URI }}">{{ ref.URI }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

    {% if workflow.fields %}
    <p><strong>Fields:</strong></p>
    <pre>{{ workflow.fields|pprint }}</pre>
    {% endif %}

    {% if workflow.display_layout %}
    <p><strong>Display Layout:</strong></p>
    <pre>{{ workflow.display_layout }}</pre>
    {% endif %}

    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for task in tasks %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'task_definition_detail' task.id %}">{{ task.title }}</a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No tasks defined for this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for transition in transitions %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'transition_detail' transition.id %}">
            {% if transition.from_task %}
                {{ transition.from_task.title }} ->
            {% else %}
                Start ->
            {% endif %}
            {% if transition.to_task %}
                {{ transition.to_task.title }}
            {% else %}
                {{ transition.to_status }}
            {% endif %}
        </a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No transitions defined for this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    <h3>Tickets</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for ticket in tickets %}
        <li><a href="{% url 'ticket_definition_detail' ticket.id %}">{{ ticket.title }}</a></li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No ticket definitions associated with this workflow.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endblock %}
</content>
</update_file>

In this updated version:

1. The WorkflowDefinition fields are presented more like status and description, with bold labels followed by their values.
2. External References, Fields, and Display Layout are only shown if they contain data, to avoid empty sections.
3. The layout is more compact and consistent with the original presentation of status and description.
4. Tasks, Transitions, and Tickets sections remain unchanged, as they still need their own headers and lists.

This revised template should provide a cleaner, more consistent view of the WorkflowDefinition while still including all the necessary information.

=======================

OK, I believe we are ready to start designing some workflows. I am going to start a new conversation for that.

Before I close this one out, I would like to get your input on the content that would be helpful to include in order for us to design the workflows.

When designing the workflows, I would like to share _no_ files. In fact, I would like to only include the document "Workflow Definition Guide" and not the "TicketFlower Project Overview".

I believe the current "Workflow Definition Guide" may not have enough information. Could you make list the information you think should be added so that it would be an adequate source for designing workflows.  

================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! To make the "Workflow Definition Guide" a more comprehensive source for designing workflows without relying on other documents or shared files, I suggest adding the following information:

1. Introduction to TicketFlower:
   - Brief overview of the TicketFlower system
   - Purpose and main features of the workflow management system

2. User Roles:
   - Description of different user roles (e.g., ticket_admin, workflow_creator)
   - Permissions associated with each role

3. Workflow Components:
   - Detailed explanation of each component (Workflow, Task, Transition, Ticket)
   - Relationships between components

4. Field Types:
   - List and description of available field types for custom fields

5. Task Types:
   - Detailed explanation of FORM task type
   - Placeholder information for future task types (SYNC_ACTION, ASYNC_ACTION)

6. Transition Conditions:
   - Explanation of how to define and use conditional transitions
   - Examples of common condition patterns

7. Ticket Access Control:
   - Explanation of how to use company_role_access for tickets
   - Examples of role-based access configurations

8. Best Practices:
   - Guidelines for creating efficient and effective workflows
   - Tips for naming conventions and organization

9. Limitations and Constraints:
   - Any current system limitations or constraints to be aware of when designing workflows

10. Example Workflows:
    - A few simple example workflows to illustrate different concepts

11. Glossary:
    - Definitions of key terms used throughout the guide

12. Workflow Design Process:
    - Step-by-step guide on how to approach designing a new workflow

13. Testing and Validation:
    - Guidelines for testing and validating workflows before implementation

By including this additional information in the "Workflow Definition Guide," it should provide a more comprehensive resource for designing workflows without needing to reference other documents or files.

==================

/unshare /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/workflow_definitions_list.html /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/workflow_definition_detail.html /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/task_definition_detail.html /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/ticket_definition_detail.html /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/transition_detail.html /app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/workflow_components_upload.html

==================

That's a good list. It doesn't look like we can modify the existing document. We should start from scratch.

I'd like you to create an outline for the new "Workflow Definition Guide".

11. Glossary of Terms

I think this looks like an excellent outline for a user. However, there is one twist in what I want to do. I want the process of creating a workflow to be an interactive process between and AI assistant and a user. We will actually need a document for the user and a document for the AI assistant.

Let's work on the guide targeted for the AI assistant. I already have a rough idea of what the user needs to know, and I will really need some trial runs to figure out exactly what we should say there.

Assume the user will communicate the information of what he wants in the workflow, in some way:

- Tasks with inputs and outputs
- A flow chart connecting the tasks, including verbal descriptions of an transitions.
- The general fields for the workflow
- The general fields for the ticket(s), which kicks off the workflow.

The AI will need to do the following:

- Know all the fields that need to be populated
- Create JSON schemas for the given schema variables: fields, inputs and outputs
- Work out the transition logic, encoded into a JSON
- Formulate the ext_ref JSOns for external links
- Understand the company roles logic

At a later time, we should also document how to advise the user on how he should best do his job. We will do that later though.

Does that make sense?

I would like you to imagine yourself in the position of an AI assistant helping a user to upload a workflow. I want you to think about the context information that would enable you to best help the user populate the workflow. Create an outline for that.

(If you end up with the same outline, that's OK. Produce what you think will help the most.)

==================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! I understand that you want to create a guide specifically for an AI assistant to help users interactively create workflows in TicketFlower.

===============

Looks good.

Before I go, I would like you to do one more thing. Please make a list of all the fields in each of the objects: WorkflowDefinition, TaskDefinition, TicketDefinition and WorkflowTransition in markdown format with a description of each one, including options for enumerations.

================

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! Here's a markdown-formatted list of all the fields for each object, including descriptions and options for enumerations:

====================

I would like to make one update to that. For the layouts, instead of "TextField, optional, react component source to display a ticket instance", I want the source to be for a Django form. Let me know what text I should substitute there. No need to reproduce the output.

Also I was wondering which documentation you saw the react component on. I want to update that too. I used to use react component but now I'm going with Django forms. 

=================

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for the confusion. You're right, and I made a mistake in referencing React components. This was an error on my part, likely carried over from outdated information or a misinterpretation. There isn't any documentation that mentions React components; I incorrectly included that detail.

For the layouts, instead of "TextField, optional, react component source to display a ticket instance", we should use:

"TextField, optional, Django form content to display a ticket instance"

This change should be applied consistently across all instances where layout fields are mentioned (display_layout, edit_layout) for WorkflowDefinition, TaskDefinition, and TicketDefinition.

Thank you for catching this. It's important to keep the documentation accurate and aligned with the current implementation using Django forms.
