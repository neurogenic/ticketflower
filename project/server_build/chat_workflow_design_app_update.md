# Project Update Information

I want to update the workflow process for my TicketFlower application. In particular, right now I want to work on the workflow_design application.

workflow_design application:

- Remove WorkflowTransitions, the "flow connectors".
- Use an implicit "flow connector" based on the input_fields of a task. If any input field for a task is modified, then the task will be triggered as if there were a transition to it. There remains a "condition", moved from transmission to task, which indicates if the task should be run.
- Added a workspace completion, where previously this functionality was kept in the workspace transition.

Here are the DB associated DB changes:

DB Changes:

- WorkspaceDefinitions
    - fields: JSONB -> fields_schema: JSONB
        - Simple name update
- TaskDefinitions
    - input_schema: JSONB -> input_fields: VARCHAR(100) []
        - Specify fields in the task, referencing fields and the associated schema from the workspace definition
    - output_schema: JSONB -> output_fields: VARCHAR(100) []
        - Specify fields in the task, referencing fields and the associated schema from the workspace definition
    - ADD condition: JSONB
        - If the task is triggered (by an update to dependency/input field), this condition tells if the task should be executed (formerly in WorkspaceTransition)
    - ADD company_role_access: INTEGER []
- TicketDefinitions:
    - fields: JSONB -> fields: VARCHAR(100) []
        - Specify fields in the ticket, referencing fields and the associated schema from the workspace definition
- WorkflowTransitions: DELETED
    - Transitions are now implicit based on a change in an input field for the task. Conditions can be used to further restrict when the task is run.
- WorkflowCompletion: ADD
    - Previously we the transition doubled as a completion condition. Now we explicitly include workflow completions. They are triggered wimilar to how a task is triggered.


## Schema SQL

Here is the schema as designed in SQL related to workflow_design and workflow_ops. Use this as a reference for the Django field design.

```sql

CREATE TYPE workflow_def_status AS ENUM ('DRAFT', 'ACTIVE', 'ARCHIVED');
CREATE TYPE task_status AS ENUM ('OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'PENDING', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED', 'ERROR');
CREATE TYPE workflow_status AS ENUM ('NOT_STARTED', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED', 'ON_HOLD');
CREATE TYPE task_type AS ENUM ('FORM', 'SYNC_ACTION', 'ASYNC_ACTION');
CREATE TYPE error_type AS ENUM ('WORKFLOW_CREATION', 'TASK_CREATION', 'TASK_UPDATE', 'WORKFLOW_TRANSITION');
CREATE TYPE error_status AS ENUM ('NEW', 'REVIEWED', 'RESOLVED');

==========================

I want to update the database in my TicketFlower Django server, specifically for the workflow_design application. Please review the provided material and ask me any questions you have before we get started with the updates. 

=====================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for sharing the files. I've reviewed the contents, particularly the `workflow_design/models.py` file. Now I have a clearer picture of the current state of the models. Based on this information, I have a few questions and observations:

1. The current `WorkflowDefinition` model has a `fields` field, which according to the new schema should be renamed to `fields_schema`. Is this correct?

2. The `TaskDefinition` model currently has `input_schema` and `output_schema` fields. These need to be changed to `input_fields` and `output_fields` as ArrayFields of VARCHAR(100). Is this understanding correct?

3. The `TicketDefinition` model's `fields` field needs to be changed from JSONField to an ArrayField of VARCHAR(100). Is this correct?

4. The `WorkflowTransitions` model needs to be removed entirely. Is this correct?

5. We need to add a new `WorkflowCompletion` model. Should this be added to the workflow_design app or to the workflow_ops app?

6. The `TaskDefinition` model needs a new `condition` JSONField and a `company_role_access` ArrayField. Is this correct?

7. Are there any data in the existing database that we need to migrate or preserve when making these changes?

8. Do you want to implement these changes as a new migration, or should we create a new initial migration after updating the models?

Once you confirm these points and provide any additional information, we can proceed with updating the models and creating the necessary migrations.

====================

1. Yes. Given the new field definitions in later tables, this is a better name.

2. Yes. Restating the schema here is redundant, given that it is in the workflow definition.

3. Yes. This also is redundant if the schema is restated here and in the workflow definition.

4. Yes, we are using "implicit" transitions.

5. Yes. Previously the WorkflowTransition had the double duty of specifying a transition to a task or a completion. Now we need to have only a completion.

6. Yes. The condition is used to indicate if the task should be run based on the current state, such as the input fields. The company role access is used to better control who can run the task.

7. There is no valuable data in the database. It would be OK to delete the contents of the workflow definitions and associated fields, in case that makes things easier.

8. I don't have a preference about how th emigration is done. I don't think I know enough to make a judgement there. Use your best discretion.

==============================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your responses, I'll proceed with updating the models in the `workflow_design/models.py` file. We'll create a new migration to implement these changes, and since there's no valuable data to preserve, we'll start fresh.

Let's update the models:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/models.py</path>
<content>
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField
from django.db import models
from users.models import Company, CustomUser

    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

    ]

    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    company_role_access = ArrayField(models.IntegerField(), blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.workflow.title} - {self.title} (v{self.version})"

class TicketDefinition(models.Model):

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.company.name} - {self.title} (v{self.version})"

class WorkflowCompletion(models.Model):
    WORKFLOW_STATUSES = [
        ('NOT_STARTED', 'Not Started'),
        ('IN_PROGRESS', 'In Progress'),
        ('COMPLETED', 'Completed'),
        ('CANCELLED', 'Cancelled'),
        ('ON_HOLD', 'On Hold')
    ]

    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    workflow = models.ForeignKey(WorkflowDefinition, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    ext_ref = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)
    completion_status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=WORKFLOW_STATUSES)
    fields = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=100), blank=True, null=True)
    condition = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True, help_text="JSON condition to evaluate")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.workflow.title} - {self.title} (v{self.version})"
</content>
</update_file>

Now, let's create a new migration for these changes:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py makemigrations workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

After running this command, we should see output indicating that a new migration has been created. We'll then need to apply this migration:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

These changes will update the database schema according to our new model definitions.

Next, we should update the admin.py file to reflect these changes:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/admin.py</path>
<content>
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import WorkflowDefinition, TaskDefinition, TicketDefinition, WorkflowCompletion

@admin.register(WorkflowDefinition)
class WorkflowDefinitionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'company', 'version', 'status', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    list_filter = ('company', 'status', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    search_fields = ('title', 'description')

@admin.register(TaskDefinition)
class TaskDefinitionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'workflow', 'task_type', 'version', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    list_filter = ('workflow', 'task_type', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    search_fields = ('title', 'description')

@admin.register(TicketDefinition)
class TicketDefinitionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'company', 'workflow', 'version', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    list_filter = ('company', 'workflow', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    search_fields = ('title', 'description')

@admin.register(WorkflowCompletion)
class WorkflowCompletionAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'workflow', 'completion_status', 'version', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    list_filter = ('workflow', 'completion_status', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
    search_fields = ('title', 'description')
</content>
</update_file>

These changes update the models according to the new schema, remove the WorkflowTransitions model, and add the new WorkflowCompletion model. The admin interface has also been updated to reflect these changes.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain further?

====================

I did the update for the model file and the admin file. I tried the update but it didn't work because WorkflowTransition is references elsewhere in the code, in the view.

Can you take a look at the file and ask me any questions you have about updating that.

====================

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for the confusion. I can see the views.py file now. Thank you for sharing it. After reviewing the file, I can see that we need to make several changes to remove references to WorkflowTransitions and adjust the logic. Here are the main points we need to address:

1. Remove imports and references to WorkflowTransitions.
2. Update the workflow_definition_detail view to remove transitions.
3. Update the task_definition_detail view to remove transitions.
4. Remove the transition_detail view.
5. Update the workflow_components_upload view to remove transition-related logic.

Before I propose the changes, I have a few questions:

1. Since we're removing WorkflowTransitions, how would you like to represent the flow between tasks now? Should we add any new logic to show task dependencies based on input_fields?

2. In the workflow_components_upload view, we currently have forms for tasks, transitions, and tickets. Should we keep the ticket form and add a form for WorkflowCompletion instead of transitions?

3. Are there any specific new features or logic you'd like to add to replace the functionality that was previously handled by WorkflowTransitions?

Once you provide this information, I can suggest the appropriate updates for the views.py file.

=======================

For the time being we will be doing absolute minimal display and edit layouts for the workflows and constituent elements. We will be developing this later. For now I just want to get it up and running. Users will be doing simple field-based uploads for all entries. We can basically remove the transitions display/uploads and add the completion display/uploads. I would suggest the completions be after the tickets on the page, when it comes to that.

1. No explicit task dependency logic for now.
2. Yes, we will have a form for WorkflowCompletions rather than WorkflowTransitions.
3. No, noting beyond the other changes already listed.

==================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for the clarification. Based on your response, I'll update the views.py file to remove WorkflowTransitions, add WorkflowCompletion, and simplify the display and edit layouts. Here's the updated views.py file:

    }

    return render(request, 'workflow_design/workflow_components_upload.html', context)
</content>
</update_file>

These changes accomplish the following:

1. Removed all references to WorkflowTransitions.
2. Added WorkflowCompletion to relevant views and forms.
3. Simplified the task_definition_detail view by removing transition-related logic.
4. Removed the transition_detail view and added a completion_detail view.
5. Updated the workflow_components_upload view to include WorkflowCompletion instead of WorkflowTransitions.

You'll need to update your templates to reflect these changes, particularly:

1. workflow_definition_detail.html
2. task_definition_detail.html
3. workflow_components_upload.html

Also, you'll need to create a new template for completion_detail.html.

Lastly, don't forget to update your urls.py file to reflect these changes, especially removing the transition_detail URL and adding the completion_detail URL.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain further?

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for sharing the template files. I'll update them to reflect the changes we've made in the views and models. Let's start with updating each template:

1. workflow_definition_detail.html:

<update_file>

<content>
{% extends "workflow_design/base.html" %}

{% block workflow_design_content %}
    <h2>Workflow Components for: {{ workflow.title }}</h2>

        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ task_form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit" name="submit_task">Add Task</button>

    <h3>Existing Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for task in tasks %}

    {% empty %}
        <li>No completions defined yet.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% endblock %}
</content>
</update_file>

Now, we need to create a new template for completion_detail.html:

<create_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/templates/workflow_design/completion_detail.html</path>
<content>
{% extends "workflow_design/base.html" %}

{% block workflow_design_content %}
    <h2>Completion: {{ completion.title }}</h2>
    <p>Workflow: <a href="{% url 'workflow_definition_detail' completion.workflow.id %}">{{ completion.workflow.title }}</a></p>
    <p>Status: {{ completion.get_completion_status_display }}</p>
    <p>Version: {{ completion.version }}</p>
    <p>Description: {{ completion.description }}</p>

    {% if completion.ext_ref %}
    <h3>External References</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for ref in completion.ext_ref %}
        <li>{{ ref.Label }}: {{ ref.Desc }} - <a href="{{ ref.URI }}">{{ ref.URI }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for field in completion.fields %}
        <li>{{ field }}</li>
    {% empty %}
        <li>No fields defined.</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>

    {% if completion.condition %}
    <h3>Condition</h3>
    <pre>{{ completion.condition|pprint }}</pre>
    {% endif %}

    {% if completion.display_layout %}
    <h3>Display Layout</h3>
    <pre>{{ completion.display_layout }}</pre>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
</content>
</create_file>

These updates reflect the changes we made to the models and views. The templates now show the relevant information for each model and remove any references to transitions.

Don't forget to update your urls.py file to include the new completion_detail view and remove the transition_detail view.

Is there anything else you'd like me to modify or explain further?

===============

I've made those updates.

I tried the migrations again but I got an error because the transitions were referenced in the urls.py. I believe that is shared. If not, let me know.

=============

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for overlooking the urls.py file. You're right, we need to update it to remove the references to transitions and add the new completion view. Let's take a look at the urls.py file and make the necessary changes.

If the urls.py file is not shared, please let me know, and I'll provide instructions on how to update it. For now, I'll assume it's shared and proceed with the updates:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/urls.py</path>
<content>
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.workflow_definitions_list, name='workflow_definitions_list'),
    path('<int:workflow_id>/', views.workflow_definition_detail, name='workflow_definition_detail'),
    path('task/<int:task_id>/', views.task_definition_detail, name='task_definition_detail'),
    path('ticket/<int:ticket_id>/', views.ticket_definition_detail, name='ticket_definition_detail'),
    path('completion/<int:completion_id>/', views.completion_detail, name='completion_detail'),
    path('upload/', views.workflow_definition_upload, name='workflow_definition_upload'),
    path('<int:workflow_id>/upload/', views.workflow_definition_upload, name='workflow_definition_update'),
    path('<int:workflow_id>/components/', views.workflow_components_upload, name='workflow_components_upload'),
]
</content>
</update_file>

These changes remove any references to transitions and add the new completion_detail view.

Now that we've updated the urls.py file, you should be able to run the migrations without any errors related to transitions. Let's try running the migrations again:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py makemigrations workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

After this command completes successfully, apply the migrations:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

These commands should now run without any errors related to transitions.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help with or explain further?

======================

/share users/models.py

I got an error executing the migrations related to the company roles references.

django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: cannot cast type jsonb to integer[]
LINE 1: ...access" TYPE integer[] USING "company_role_access"::integer[...

I think I made a mistake on the company roles information. I have shared the user models that include the company roles. Could you take a look at that and update the workspace_design tickets and tasks to properly handle the company roles?

===================

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for the oversight. Let's take a look at the users models and update the workflow_design models accordingly to properly handle the company roles.

After reviewing the shared users/models.py file, I see that we have a CompanyRole model. We should use this model for the company role access in our TaskDefinition and TicketDefinition models instead of an integer array.

Let's update the workflow_design/models.py file to correct this:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/models.py</path>
<content>
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField
from django.db import models
from users.models import Company, CustomUser, CompanyRole

class WorkflowDefinition(models.Model):
    # ... (keep the existing WorkflowDefinition model as is)

class TaskDefinition(models.Model):
    TASK_TYPES = [
        ('FORM', 'Form'),
        ('SYNC_ACTION', 'Synchronous Action'),
        ('ASYNC_ACTION', 'Asynchronous Action'),
    ]

    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    workflow = models.ForeignKey(WorkflowDefinition, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    ext_ref = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)
    task_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=TASK_TYPES)
    input_fields = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=100), blank=True, null=True)
    output_fields = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=100), blank=True, null=True)
    condition = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True, help_text="JSON condition to evaluate")
    version = models.IntegerField(default=1)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    edit_layout = models.TextField(blank=True)  # Django form source, to edit a task instance
    display_layout = models.TextField(blank=True)  # Django form source, to display a task instance
    action_url = models.URLField(blank=True)  # url for async, sync action
    input_transform = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)  # input transform for async and sync action
    output_transform = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)  # output transform for sync action and async action
    timeout_seconds = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)  # timeout for sync action
    company_role_access = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole, blank=True, related_name='accessible_tasks')

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.workflow.title} - {self.title} (v{self.version})"

class TicketDefinition(models.Model):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    ext_ref = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)  # Array of {Label: String, Desc: String, URI: String}
    workflow = models.ForeignKey(WorkflowDefinition, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    fields = ArrayField(models.CharField(max_length=100), blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    version = models.IntegerField(default=1)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    company_role_access = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole, blank=True, related_name='accessible_tickets')
    edit_layout = models.TextField(blank=True)  # Django form source, to edit a ticket instance
    display_layout = models.TextField(blank=True)  # Django form source, to display a ticket instance

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.company.name} - {self.title} (v{self.version})"

class WorkflowCompletion(models.Model):
    # ... (keep the existing WorkflowCompletion model as is)
</content>
</update_file>

Now that we've updated the models, we need to create a new migration to reflect these changes. Run the following commands:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py makemigrations workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

After this command completes successfully, apply the migrations:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

These changes should resolve the error you encountered. We've replaced the `company_role_access` ArrayField with a ManyToManyField to the CompanyRole model for both TaskDefinition and TicketDefinition.    

You may also need to update your forms and views to handle the ManyToManyField for company roles. In the `workflow_components_upload` view, you might want to add a multiple select field for company roles when creating or editing tasks and tickets.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help with or explain further?

===================

I have the new migration that failed 0002_remove_task_.... Should I delete that before running the new migration?

=========

...

====

I got another error that I believe is due to the existing data in the database.

django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: cannot cast type jsonb to character varying[]
LINE 1: ...COLUMN "fields" TYPE varchar(100)[] USING "fields"::varchar(...

If this is the problem, then I'm okay with deleting the existing workspace data. Should I do that? I don't have access to the database through a gui program. Could through Docker compose run a sql command in my Docker for the database.

Could I just delete the rows in the workflow_definition table?

=================

> Coder_Assistant: You're correct. The error is due to existing data in the database that doesn't match the new schema. Since you're okay with deleting the existing workspace data, we can do that using SQL commands through Docker Compose.

Here's how you can delete the rows in the workflow_design tables:

1. First, let's access the PostgreSQL database through Docker Compose:

<terminal>
<command>docker-compose exec db psql -U your_db_user -d your_db_name</command>
</terminal>

Replace `your_db_user` and `your_db_name` with the actual database user and name from your Docker Compose configuration.

2. Once you're in the PostgreSQL prompt, run the following SQL commands to delete the data from the workflow_design tables:

<terminal>
<command>
DELETE FROM workflow_design_workflowcompletion;
DELETE FROM workflow_design_ticketdefinition;
DELETE FROM workflow_design_taskdefinition;
DELETE FROM workflow_design_workflowdefinition;
\q
</command>
</terminal>

These commands will delete all rows from the WorkflowCompletion, TicketDefinition, TaskDefinition, and WorkflowDefinition tables, in that order. The `\q` command at the end will exit the PostgreSQL prompt.

3. After deleting the data, exit the database prompt and try running the migrations again:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

This should now work without the data type conversion errors.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to drop and recreate the tables. Here's how you can do that:

1. Access the PostgreSQL prompt again as described in step 1.

2. Run the following SQL commands:

<terminal>
<command>
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_workflowcompletion CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_ticketdefinition CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_taskdefinition CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_workflowdefinition CASCADE;
\q
</command>
</terminal>

3. After dropping the tables, run the migrations again:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

This will recreate the tables with the correct schema.

Remember to be cautious when deleting data or dropping tables in a production environment. Always ensure you have proper backups before performing such operations.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or if you encounter any other issues.

=====================

I think I deleted from those tables. I would like to list the contents, but I am having trouble getting anything. First, how do I list the tables? And what other commands do you suggest?

===============

...

==========

If I do a select statement on a table I don't get anything. No rows, no error, just a new cursor.

ticketflower_ops-# select * from users_company
ticketflower_ops-# select count(*) from users_company
ticketflower_ops-#

================

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for the confusion earlier. You're right, starting with a clean database might be the best approach at this point. This will help us avoid any potential conflicts with existing data or schema issues. Here's what we can do:

1. First, let's drop all the tables related to our workflow_design app and the Django migrations table. Connect to your PostgreSQL database:

<terminal>
<command>docker-compose exec db psql -U your_db_user -d your_db_name</command>
</terminal>

2. Once connected, run the following SQL commands:

<terminal>
<command>
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_workflowcompletion CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_ticketdefinition CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_taskdefinition CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workflow_design_workflowdefinition CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS django_migrations CASCADE;
\q
</command>
</terminal>

3. Now, in your project directory, remove all migration files from the workflow_design app except for the `__init__.py` file:

<terminal>
<command>
rm workflow_design/migrations/0*.py
</command>
</terminal>

4. Create a new initial migration for the workflow_design app:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py makemigrations workflow_design</command>
</terminal>

5. Apply the migrations:

<terminal>
<command>python manage.py migrate</command>
</terminal>

This should create and apply a fresh set of migrations for your workflow_design app, as well as recreate the Django migrations table with the correct information.

If you encounter any issues during this process, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot. Also, keep in mind that this process will remove all existing data in the workflow_design tables, so make sure you're okay with that before proceeding.

=================

I removed the workflow_design tables. I assume the migrations tble will include content related to the users tables? Can I delete it? If so, do I delete all the user migrations too? 

 Schema |               Name                | Type  |    Owner

Claude answered, but I think I want to do something different. I should probably update the user permissions as needed and then start a fresh db

/share ticketflower/settings.py users/models.pu user/views.py workflow_design/models.py workflow_design/views.py

==============

I'm working on the TicketFlower application and I want to review how authorization is done. I will define company roles that will control who can submit tickets, execute tasks, and do other workflow operations actions.

The workflow_ops code has not been started. Before I do that I want to understand how authorization is set up, and if it makes sense given the way I want workflow_ops to run.

Can you look over the shared files and let me know how authorization is current done for the existing code. Let me know if you would like me to share anything other files.

===============

> Coder_Assistant: Certainly! I'll review the shared files to understand how authorization is currently set up in the TicketFlower application. Let's go through the relevant parts:

1. User and Company Models (users/models.py):
   - The application uses a custom user model (CustomUser) that extends AbstractUser.
   - There's a Company model, and each user is associated with a company.
   - There's a CompanyRole model that links users to roles within a company.
   - The built-in Django Group model is used for system roles.

2. Authentication Views (users/views.py):
   - The application has views for company signup, user login, and logout.
   - There's a UserDashboardView that requires login (uses LoginRequiredMixin).

3. Workflow Design Views (workflow_design/views.py):
   - The views use the @login_required decorator to ensure users are authenticated.
   - Permission checks are done using the @permission_required decorator.
   - Permissions are checked for viewing, adding, and changing workflow definitions, task definitions, ticket definitions, and workflow completions.

4. Settings (ticketflower/settings.py):
   - The custom user model is set as AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.CustomUser'.
   - There's a custom middleware 'users.middleware.CompanyMiddleware' in the MIDDLEWARE setting.

Current Authorization Setup:
1. Authentication is handled using Django's built-in authentication system.
2. The application uses a combination of login requirements and permission checks.
3. Permissions are likely defined using Django's built-in permission system.
4. Company-specific access is controlled by filtering querysets based on the user's company.

Observations and Potential Improvements:
1. The current setup uses Django's permission system, which is good for system-wide permissions but might not be granular enough for company-specific roles.
2. There's no clear implementation of how CompanyRoles are used for authorization. You might want to implement a custom permission backend that takes CompanyRoles into account.
3. The CompanyMiddleware is not shared, but it likely adds the user's company to the request object, which is a good practice for multi-tenant applications.

Recommendations for workflow_ops:
1. Implement a custom permission backend that checks both system permissions and company roles.
2. Use class-based views with mixins for consistent permission checking across views.
3. Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) using the CompanyRole model.
4. Ensure that all querysets in workflow_ops filter objects based on the user's company.

To proceed, it would be helpful to see the following files:
1. The CompanyMiddleware implementation (users/middleware.py)
2. Any custom permission backends if they exist
3. The urls.py files to see how the views are mapped to URLs

With this information, we can provide more specific recommendations for implementing authorization in the workflow_ops module.

==============

I don't think there are any custom backends. If you see any in the file listing, let me know.

What would it take to used company roles to control access to the workflows design fields? I do want a way to create a company admin too, who has access to everything (I think - TBD).

==============

> Coder_Assistant: You're right, I don't see any custom permission backends in the file listing. Let's discuss how we can use company roles to control access to the workflow design fields and create a company admin role.

To implement this, we'll need to make some changes to the existing structure. Here's a plan to achieve this:

1. Enhance the CompanyRole model:
   Update the CompanyRole model in users/models.py to include permissions:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/users/models.py</path>
<content>
class CompanyRole(models.Model):
    company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='roles')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    users = models.ManyToManyField(CustomUser, related_name='company_roles')
    permissions = models.JSONField(default=dict)  # Store role-specific permissions

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('company', 'name')

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.company.name} - {self.name}"

    @classmethod
    def create_admin_role(cls, company):
        admin_role, created = cls.objects.get_or_create(
            company=company,
            name='Admin',
            defaults={
                'description': 'Company Administrator',
                'permissions': {
                    'workflow_design': ['view', 'add', 'change', 'delete'],
                    'workflow_ops': ['view', 'add', 'change', 'delete'],
                    'user_management': ['view', 'add', 'change', 'delete'],
                }
            }
        )
        return admin_role
</content>
</update_file>

2. Create a custom permission backend:
   Create a new file named permissions.py in the users app:

<create_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/users/permissions.py</path>
<content>
from django.contrib.auth.backends import BaseBackend

class CompanyRoleBackend(BaseBackend):
    def has_perm(self, user_obj, perm, obj=None):
        if not user_obj.is_active or user_obj.is_anonymous:
            return False

        if user_obj.is_superuser:
            return True

        app_label, action = perm.split('.')
        for role in user_obj.company_roles.all():
            if app_label in role.permissions:
                if action in role.permissions[app_label]:
                    return True

        return False

    def has_module_perms(self, user_obj, app_label):
        if not user_obj.is_active or user_obj.is_anonymous:
            return False

        if user_obj.is_superuser:
            return True

        for role in user_obj.company_roles.all():
            if app_label in role.permissions:
                return True

        return False
</content>
</create_file>

3. Update settings.py to use the new permission backend:
   Add the following to your AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS in settings.py:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/ticketflower/settings.py</path>
<content>
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'users.permissions.CompanyRoleBackend',
]
</content>
</update_file>

4. Update the CompanySignUpView to create an admin role:
   Modify the CompanySignUpView in users/views.py:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/users/views.py</path>
<content>
class CompanySignUpView(View):
    template_name = 'users/company_signup.html'

    def get(self, request):
        form = CompanySignUpForm()
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})

    def post(self, request):
        form = CompanySignUpForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            company = Company.objects.create(name=form.cleaned_data['company_name'])
            user = User.objects.create_user(
                email=form.cleaned_data['email'],
                password=form.cleaned_data['password'],
                company=company,
                is_staff=True
            )
            admin_role = CompanyRole.create_admin_role(company)
            admin_role.users.add(user)
            login(request, user)
            return redirect('user_dashboard')
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'form': form})
</content>
</update_file>

5. Update the workflow_design views to use the new permission system:
   Modify the views in workflow_design/views.py to use the new permission checks:

<update_file>
<path>/app/ticketflower/ticketflower_ops_server/workflow_design/views.py</path>
<content>
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

def company_role_required(permission):
    def decorator(view_func):
        @login_required
        def wrapped_view(request, *args, **kwargs):
            if request.user.has_perm(f'workflow_design.{permission}'):
                return view_func(request, *args, **kwargs)
            else:
                raise PermissionDenied
        return wrapped_view
    return decorator

@company_role_required('view_workflowdefinition')
def workflow_definitions_list(request):
    # ... existing code ...

@company_role_required('view_workflowdefinition')
def workflow_definition_detail(request, workflow_id):
    # ... existing code ...

@company_role_required('add_workflowdefinition')
def workflow_definition_upload(request, workflow_id=None):
    # ... existing code ...

# Apply similar changes to other views
</content>
</update_file>

These changes will:
1. Allow you to define granular permissions for each company role.
2. Create a company admin role with full access to all features.
3. Use a custom permission backend to check company-specific roles and permissions.
4. Automatically create an admin role and assign it to the user who signs up a new company.

To use this system in the workflow_ops module (when you start implementing it), you'll follow a similar pattern:
1. Define the necessary permissions in the CompanyRole model.
2. Use the @company_role_required decorator or similar permission checks in your views.
3. Ensure that all querysets filter objects based on the user's company.

This setup provides a flexible foundation for role-based access control within each company, while still allowing for system-wide superusers who can access everything across all companies.

========================

I just got to #1. I don't know if that is what I had in mind. I wanted standard role based access. For example, to create roles like "hr" and allow that role to work on "hr" tickets.

Rather than writing code, maybe we should stick to a higher level conversation now.

===================

> Coder_Assistant: I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're absolutely right, and I agree that we should have a higher-level conversation about the role-based access control you have in mind. Let's take a step back and discuss this at a conceptual level.

Based on your comment, it seems you're looking for a more straightforward role-based access control (RBAC) system that aligns with business functions. Here's a high-level approach we could consider:       

1. Role Definition:
   - Define roles that correspond to business functions or departments (e.g., "HR", "Finance", "IT Support").
   - These roles would be company-specific.

2. Workflow and Ticket Association:
   - Associate workflows and ticket types with specific roles.
   - For example, an "HR" workflow or ticket type would be associated with the "HR" role.

3. Access Control:
   - Users assigned to a role would have access to workflows and tickets associated with that role.
   - A user could have multiple roles if needed.

4. Company Admin Role:
   - Have a special "Company Admin" role that has access to everything within the company.

5. Permissions:
   - Instead of granular permissions, focus on role-based access to entire workflows or ticket types.
   - Permissions could be simplified to "can access" or "cannot access" for each workflow or ticket type.

6. Implementation Approach:
   - Use Django's built-in Group model to represent roles.
   - Create a many-to-many relationship between workflows/ticket types and roles.
   - When checking permissions, verify if the user has a role that's associated with the workflow or ticket type they're trying to access.

This approach would allow you to:
- Easily create and manage roles that align with your business structure.
- Assign users to roles based on their job functions.
- Control access to workflows and tickets based on these roles.
- Maintain flexibility by allowing users to have multiple roles if needed.

Does this align more closely with what you had in mind for role-based access in TicketFlower? If so, we can discuss how to implement this within your existing structure. If not, please provide more details about your vision for role-based access, and we can refine the approach accordingly.

=================

Yes, that is more what I had in mind. I want to allow the customer company to define whatever roles they want and this would control access to their tickets, etc. I also want to have an customer company admin how could access everything.

There is another thing I wanted, user-specific authorization. Whereas all users may have access to a number of tickets, like maybe the "vacation request ticket", but I also wanted to be able to assign some tasks instances to specific individuals.  So maybe in the task_instance there would be a way to add an additional user(s) constraint on top of the role constraints associate with a ticket type. Do you understand what I mean?

================

> Coder_Assistant: Absolutely, I understand what you mean. Your vision for the authorization system is clearer now. Let's break it down into key components:

1. Company-Defined Roles:
   - Allow each customer company to define their own roles (e.g., "HR", "Manager", "Employee").
   - These roles would be used to control access to ticket types and workflows.

2. Company Admin Role:
   - A special role with full access to everything within the company.

3. Role-Based Access Control:
   - Assign roles to users.
   - Associate ticket types and workflows with roles.
   - Users can access tickets and workflows based on their roles.

4. User-Specific Authorization:
   - On top of role-based access, allow for user-specific assignments.
   - For task instances, provide the ability to assign specific users, overriding or supplementing the role-based access.

Here's a high-level design to accommodate these requirements:

1. Models:
   ```python
   class CompanyRole(models.Model):
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)

   class UserRole(models.Model):
       user = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       role = models.ForeignKey(CompanyRole, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

   class TicketType(models.Model):
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       allowed_roles = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole)

   class TaskInstance(models.Model):
       ticket = models.ForeignKey(Ticket, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       assigned_users = models.ManyToManyField(CustomUser, blank=True)
       # other fields...
   ```

2. Authorization Logic:
   - For ticket access:
     ```python
     def can_access_ticket(user, ticket):
         user_roles = UserRole.objects.filter(user=user).values_list('role', flat=True)
         return ticket.ticket_type.allowed_roles.filter(id__in=user_roles).exists() or \
                UserRole.objects.filter(user=user, role__is_admin=True).exists()
     ```

   - For task access:
     ```python
     def can_access_task(user, task):
         return can_access_ticket(user, task.ticket) or \
                task.assigned_users.filter(id=user.id).exists()
     ```

3. Views and Forms:
   - Create views and forms that allow company admins to:
     - Define roles
     - Assign roles to users
     - Associate roles with ticket types
   - When creating or editing task instances, allow for specific user assignments

4. Middleware or Decorators:
   - Implement middleware or decorators to check permissions before allowing access to views or actions

This design allows for:
- Flexible, company-defined roles
- Role-based access to ticket types and workflows
- A company admin role with full access
- User-specific assignments for tasks, overriding role-based access when needed

To implement this, you'd need to:
1. Update your models to include these new relationships
2. Create views and forms for managing roles and assignments
3. Implement the authorization logic in your views and API endpoints
4. Update your templates to reflect these new access controls

Does this align with your vision for the authorization system? Would you like to discuss any specific part of this design in more detail?

==============

At a high level I think that is what I want. Maybe we need to work out the details for workflow_ops.

**Company Admin Role**

Admin has access to everything. (We may add ways of protecting data later.)

**Workflow Design**

We will have a special role to create workflows.

- workflow_definition
- task_definition
- ticket_definition
- completion_definition

**Workflow Ops**

Here the companies will specify by role who can do what.

Workflow ops objects:

- workflow_instance - an instance of a workflow_definition
- workflow_data - data for the workflow at a given step in the workflow.
- task_instance - an instance of a task_definition object 
- ticket_instance - an instance of a ticket_definition that starts a workflow intance
- completion_instance - an instance of a completion_definition that ends a workflow instance

general roles:

- A ticket definition will specify what roles can submit this ticket type
- A workflow definition will specify what roles can administer the ticket (view tickets, assign tickets, etc)
- A task definition will specify what roles can execute this task type (for manual tasks)
- A task instance will specify specific users who can execute a task (for manual tasks)

I am not sure if this gives all the information needed. Please look this over and let me know if I'm missing anything.

======================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for providing this detailed overview. It's a great starting point for designing the authorization system for workflow_ops. Let's review the information you've provided and identify any potential gaps or areas that need further clarification.

Your structure looks good overall. Here's a summary of what you've described, along with some thoughts and questions:

1. Company Admin Role:
   - Full access to everything within the company
   - Consideration for future data protection mechanisms

2. Workflow Design:
   - Special role for creating workflows
   - Covers workflow_definition, task_definition, ticket_definition, and completion_definition

3. Workflow Ops:
   - Company-specific role-based permissions
   - Objects: workflow_instance, workflow_data, task_instance, ticket_instance, completion_instance

4. General Roles:
   - Ticket submission roles
   - Workflow administration roles
   - Task execution roles (for manual tasks)
   - User-specific task assignments

This structure provides a good foundation. Here are some areas we might want to consider or clarify:

1. Workflow Instance Administration:
   - Do we need roles for starting, pausing, or canceling workflow instances?
   - Should there be roles for viewing the progress of workflow instances?

2. Data Access:
   - How granular should data access be? Should roles be able to specify read/write access to specific fields in workflow_data?

3. Reporting and Auditing:
   - Do we need roles for generating reports or viewing audit logs?

4. Role Hierarchy:
   - Should there be a concept of role hierarchy? For example, could a "Manager" role automatically include permissions of an "Employee" role?

5. Time-based or Conditional Permissions:
   - Do we need to consider time-based roles or permissions that change based on the state of the workflow?

6. Multi-step Approval Processes:
   - How do we handle scenarios where a task requires approval from multiple roles or specific users?

7. Delegation:
   - Should users be able to delegate their tasks or permissions to others temporarily?

8. External Participants:
   - How do we handle permissions for external participants who might need limited access to specific tasks or data?

9. Role Combinations:
   - Do we need to consider scenarios where a combination of roles is required to perform certain actions?

10. Default Roles:
    - Should there be a set of default roles that every company starts with, which they can then customize?

To move forward, we should:

1. Define the exact permissions associated with each role type (e.g., what does "administer the ticket" entail?)
2. Decide on the data model for storing these roles and permissions
3. Design the interface for company admins to manage roles and permissions
4. Plan how these permissions will be enforced in the backend (e.g., through decorators, middleware, or a custom permission system)

Would you like to focus on any specific area of this authorization system to flesh out in more detail? Or should we start by defining a more detailed data model for roles and permissions?

===============

I'll try to clarify these role questions. The general theme will be to get a system up and running as a proof of concept. We will worry about allowing more powerful authorization specifications later. 

1. Workflow Instance Administration:
   - Do we need roles for starting, pausing, or canceling workflow instances?
   - Should there be roles for viewing the progress of workflow instances?

   - ANSWER: We will any role specified in the workflow_definition to be a "ticket_admin" role to have complete administration access within the given workflow.

2. Data Access:
   - How granular should data access be? Should roles be able to specify read/write access to specific fields in workflow_data?

   - ANSWER: For now we will not specify by fields.

3. Reporting and Auditing:
   - Do we need roles for generating reports or viewing audit logs?

   - ANSWER: We will include this in the ticket admin functionality for now.

4. Role Hierarchy:
   - Should there be a concept of role hierarchy? For example, could a "Manager" role automatically include permissions of an "Employee" role?

   - ANSWER: Not now. 

5. Time-based or Conditional Permissions:
   - Do we need to consider time-based roles or permissions that change based on the state of the workflow?

   - ANSWER: Not yet.

6. Multi-step Approval Processes:
   - How do we handle scenarios where a task requires approval from multiple roles or specific users?

   - ANSWER: A task-definition can list multiple roles and a task_instance can list multiple allowed users (but when used it wil usually be one, I imagine). The ticket will need to design a task for each user involved in a case like this.

7. Delegation:
   - Should users be able to delegate their tasks or permissions to others temporarily?

   - ANSWER: Not yet. For now we will handle this in task assignment, when that is made.

8. External Participants:
   - How do we handle permissions for external participants who might need limited access to specific tasks or data?

   - ANSWER: For now, external participants will have to have a login/role, such as a non-staff role.

9. Role Combinations:
   - Do we need to consider scenarios where a combination of roles is required to perform certain actions?

   - ANSWER: For now if a user has any role in the definition allowed list, and if applicable, any ID in the instance allowed ID list, they have permission.

10. Default Roles:
    - Should there be a set of default roles that every company starts with, which they can then customize?

    - ANSWER: I'm not sure. We will have to work this out.

Do we have enough now to more formally spell out the system?

=====================

> Coder_Assistant: Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your answers, we can now outline a more formal specification for the authorization system. Here's a detailed breakdown of the system:

1. Role Types:
   a. Company Admin: Full access to everything within the company.
   b. Workflow Designer: Can create and modify workflow definitions, task definitions, ticket definitions, and completion definitions.
   c. Ticket Admin: Can administer tickets within a specific workflow (view, assign, cancel, etc.).
   d. Ticket Submitter: Can submit specific types of tickets.
   e. Task Executor: Can execute specific types of tasks.

2. Authorization Objects:
   a. Workflow Definition
   b. Task Definition
   c. Ticket Definition
   d. Completion Definition
   e. Workflow Instance
   f. Task Instance
   g. Ticket Instance
   h. Completion Instance
   i. Workflow Data

3. Permission Specifications:
   a. Workflow Definition:
      - Specifies roles that can act as Ticket Admin for this workflow.
   b. Ticket Definition:
      - Specifies roles that can submit this ticket type.
   c. Task Definition:
      - Specifies roles that can execute this task type (for manual tasks).
      - Can specify multiple roles.
   d. Task Instance:
      - Can specify specific users who can execute this task instance.
      - Can specify multiple users.

4. Access Rules:
   a. Company Admin has full access to all objects within their company.
   b. Workflow Designer has full access to all definition objects (workflow, task, ticket, completion).
   c. Ticket Admin (as specified in Workflow Definition) can:
      - View all instances of the workflow
      - Assign tasks
      - Cancel workflow instances
      - View audit logs and generate reports for the workflow
   d. Ticket Submitter can submit tickets for types they are authorized for.
   e. Task Executor can execute tasks if:
      - They have a role specified in the Task Definition, OR
      - They are specifically assigned in the Task Instance

5. Data Model (simplified):
   ```python
   class CompanyRole(models.Model):
       company = models.ForeignKey(Company, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       is_admin = models.BooleanField(default=False)
       is_workflow_designer = models.BooleanField(default=False)

   class UserRole(models.Model):
       user = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       role = models.ForeignKey(CompanyRole, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

   class WorkflowDefinition(models.Model):
       # ... other fields ...
       ticket_admin_roles = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole)

   class TicketDefinition(models.Model):
       # ... other fields ...
       submitter_roles = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole)

   class TaskDefinition(models.Model):
       # ... other fields ...
       executor_roles = models.ManyToManyField(CompanyRole)

   class TaskInstance(models.Model):
       # ... other fields ...
       assigned_users = models.ManyToManyField(CustomUser, blank=True)
   ```

6. Authorization Checks:
   - Implement decorators or middleware to check permissions before allowing access to views or actions.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def can_execute_task(user, task_instance):
         return (
             user.company_roles.filter(is_admin=True).exists() or
             user.company_roles.filter(id__in=task_instance.task_definition.executor_roles.all()).exists() or
             task_instance.assigned_users.filter(id=user.id).exists()
         )
     ```

7. Default Roles:
   - Initially create "Company Admin" and "Employee" roles for new companies.
   - Allow company admins to create and customize additional roles as needed.

Next Steps:
1. Implement the data models for roles and permissions.
2. Create views and forms for managing roles and assigning permissions.
3. Implement the authorization logic in views and API endpoints.
4. Create decorators or middleware for permission checks.
5. Update templates and frontend to reflect these access controls.

Does this formal specification align with your vision for the authorization system? Would you like to modify or expand on any part of this specification before we move forward with implementation?
