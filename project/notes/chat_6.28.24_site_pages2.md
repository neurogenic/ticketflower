```
## Authorization and Security

- Strictly enforce a user from one company can not access any records labeled for a different company (eg ticket type or ticket instance)
    - Low priority on enforcing company id consistency between linked records (eg ticket type and ticket instance)
- System roles define access to assets within a given company. They are global and we will use hard coded values for them:
    - user
    - admin
    - ticket_admin
    - task_worker
    - workflow_creator
- Company specific roles can be defined to control access to ticket type submission. Default to companies having a role "user" and all users have this company role.

## User Management

- Company Sign-up Page
    - Fields: Company Name, Admin User Email, Admin User Password, Admin User First Name, Admin User Last Name
    - Function: Creates a new company and the first admin user
- User Login Page
    - Fields: Email, Password
- User Dashboard
    - Display user information
    - Links to other functionalities (Submit Tickets, My Tickets, etc.)
- Simple Profile Page (allows editing fields)

NOTES: For MVP, no functionality for creating additional company users

## User Ticket Pages

- Submit Tickets
- My Tickets
- Ticket Detail

Authorization note: "Company role" field is used for user access to ticket types.
TBD: Should this use the same control as the Admin list?

## Ticket Team Pages

### Ticket Team: Admin

Access to all tickets (by company)

- Tickets (Active, Archive)
- Ticket Detail

- Tasks - (Active, Archive)
- Task Detail

### Ticket Team: Task Workers

- My Tasks (To execute)
- Task Execution (For manual/Form type tasks)

TBD: Should we use the page or control from "Ticket Team: Admin" to access my tasks? This means we would need to add the link to open the task execution page too.

### Ticket Team: Workflow Designers

- Workflow Definitions
- Workflow Definition Detail
- Task Definitions
- Task Definition Detail
- Ticket Definitions
- Ticket Definition Detail

- Workflow Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Task Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Ticket Definition Upload (Create and edit)

TBD: We will have a detailed mechanism for creating workflows/tasks/tickets but for starters I want a way to upload to those tables.

### Ticket Assignment

We will support different options for assigning and tracking tickets. For starters I think we will automatically give them to the available worker with the shortest list. Later we can think about giving options here. (Also, more advanced ticket tracking and analytics will be added later.)

---

This is just an MVP for a demo. The main emphasis will be on workflow, task and ticket definitions using an AI assistant. Later, I want to add task automation from scripts and from an AI assistant, which will also be an important focus for the system. 

I have tried to go through an list out basic ticket and workflow functionality for this. It misses some features there but that can be added later.

For starters, I would like you to write out a high level summary of the system.

====================================

Thank you for providing such a detailed overview of your ticket and workflow management system. Here's a high-level summary of the system based on the information you've shared:

This summary provides an overview of the key components, features, and technical aspects of your ticket and workflow management system. It highlights the core functionality you've described while also noting the areas for future enhancement.

The system appears to be well-structured, with a focus on flexibility and customization. The use of PostgreSQL with JSONB fields and custom types allows for adaptable data structures, while the React-based dynamic layouts provide a customizable user interface.

One of the system's strengths is its multi-tenancy design with strict data isolation between companies. This, combined with the granular role-based access control, provides a solid foundation for secure and scalable multi-company usage.

The workflow and task management features seem comprehensive, allowing for complex process definitions with various task types and transition conditions. This flexibility will be valuable for accommodating a wide range of business processes.

As you mentioned, the current focus is on the MVP for demonstration purposes, with plans to add more advanced features like task automation and AI assistance in the future. This phased approach is sensible, allowing you to validate the core functionality before adding more complex features.

Is there any specific aspect of the system you'd like me to elaborate on or any questions you have about the design?

======================================

Great, thanks.

I think I can imagine how the authorization and access will work for the customers. I have one concern, however. How will this work for employees of the company (Ticketflower)? How do we run the app without being from a company. Is it possible for us to create an application account for each company and use that when we want to use the application on their behalf? The alternative as far as I know is to add a lot of extra special logic for "super users". Do I have this right? what are other options? What are other problems I will run in to?

======================================

You've raised an excellent point about how employees of Ticketflower (the company providing this service) will interact with the system. This is a common challenge in multi-tenant SaaS applications. Let's explore your suggestion and some alternatives:





# Ticketflower Employee Access Options

## 1. Application Accounts for Each Company

Your suggestion: Create an application account for each company that Ticketflower employees can use.

Pros:
- Simple to implement within the existing structure
- Maintains the multi-tenant isolation
- Allows employees to experience the exact view that customers see

Cons:
- Requires managing multiple accounts for each employee
- May not provide a unified view across all companies
- Could potentially lead to confusion about which account is being used

## 2. Super User Approach

Adding special logic for "super users" with cross-company access.

Pros:
- Provides a unified view for Ticketflower employees
- Easier account management (one account per employee)

Cons:
- Requires significant changes to the authorization logic
- May complicate the data access layer
- Could lead to accidental data exposure if not carefully implemented

## 3. Separate Admin Interface

Create a distinct admin interface for Ticketflower employees that sits outside the multi-tenant structure.

Pros:
- Keeps the multi-tenant application logic clean
- Provides a unified view for employees
- Can offer additional features specific to Ticketflower's needs

Cons:
- Requires developing and maintaining a separate application
- May duplicate some logic between the two systems

## 4. Virtual Company for Ticketflower

Create a special "Ticketflower" company within the system with extended privileges.

Pros:
- Works within the existing multi-tenant structure
- Provides a unified account for each employee
- Can leverage existing role-based access control

Cons:
- Requires some special logic to handle the Ticketflower company differently
- May complicate some queries and data access patterns

## 5. Middleware Layer for Employee Access

Implement a middleware layer that can switch between companies for authorized Ticketflower employees.

Pros:
- Maintains the existing multi-tenant structure
- Provides flexibility for employees to switch between company views
- Centralizes the cross-company access logic

Cons:
- Adds complexity to the application architecture
- Requires careful implementation to prevent data leaks

## Potential Issues to Consider

1. **Data Isolation**: Ensure that any cross-company access doesn't accidentally expose data between customers.

2. **Audit Trails**: Implement robust logging for actions performed by Ticketflower employees, especially when accessing customer data.

3. **Performance**: Cross-company queries might be more complex and could impact performance.

4. **UI/UX**: Design an intuitive interface for Ticketflower employees to navigate between companies or view aggregated data.

5. **Scalability**: Consider how the chosen solution will scale as the number of customers and data volume grows.

6. **Compliance**: Ensure the solution complies with data protection regulations, especially when employees access customer data.

7. **Feature Parity**: If using a separate admin interface, ensure it stays up-to-date with features in the main application.

## Recommendation

A combination of approaches might work best:

1. Implement the "Virtual Company for Ticketflower" approach for basic multi-tenant compatibility.
2. Add a middleware layer for seamless company switching.
3. Create a separate admin interface for Ticketflower-specific operations that don't fit the multi-tenant model.

This combined approach provides flexibility, maintains data isolation, and allows for specialized Ticketflower operations while minimizing changes to the core multi-tenant structure.


This analysis covers various approaches to solving the Ticketflower employee access issue, each with its own pros and cons. The recommendation at the end suggests a hybrid approach that balances flexibility, security, and ease of implementation.

To address your specific questions:

1. Yes, creating application accounts for each company is a viable option, especially for smaller-scale operations or during the initial phases of the system.

2. The "super user" approach is indeed an alternative, but as noted, it can complicate the authorization logic significantly.

3. Other options include creating a separate admin interface, using a virtual Ticketflower company, or implementing a middleware layer for employee access.

The main problems you might run into, regardless of the approach chosen, include:

1. Ensuring proper data isolation and preventing accidental data leaks between companies.
2. Managing performance, especially for cross-company operations.
3. Maintaining a clear and auditable record of employee actions across different companies.
4. Balancing the need for a unified employee experience with the multi-tenant architecture.

Would you like to discuss any of these approaches in more detail, or do you have any other concerns about implementing Ticketflower employee access?

=================================

For the site I mentioned above, would it be possible to to plain react (with something like useReducer rather than redux) on the front end and Django on the back end. Possibly using Vite to serve react, at least for development. Let me know where I might run into problems. You can answer slightly longer on this one.
