============

I am working at a indoor map company. We have made a system for customers to submit orders for new maps or for map update requests. They fill out a form including uploading any needed source material. This then triggers a workflow in our operations to create or update the map. I'm wondering if they're commercial products available to handle these order or ticket submissions and then the subsequent workflow that it kicks off.

Your question is relevant to workflow management and customer request handling systems. There are indeed commercial products available that can handle order submissions, ticket management, and the subsequent workflows. These are often categorized as Service Request Management (SRM) or Workflow Management Systems. Here are a few options that might suit your needs:

1. ServiceNow: A comprehensive platform that can handle customer service requests, workflows, and IT service management. It's highly customizable and can be tailored to specific business processes.

2. Jira Service Management: From Atlassian, this tool is designed to handle service requests and manage workflows. It's particularly good for teams already using other Atlassian products.

3. Zendesk: While primarily known for customer support, Zendesk also offers workflow management capabilities and can handle service requests.

4. Freshservice: This is an IT service management tool that can be adapted for various business processes, including handling customer requests and managing workflows.

5. Monday.com: A versatile work operating system that can be customized to handle order submissions and subsequent workflows.

6. Pipefy: A business process management platform that allows you to create custom workflows for various business processes.
