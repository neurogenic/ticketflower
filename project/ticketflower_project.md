# TicketFlower Project Overview

This is an overview of the Ticketflower project, an web site for ticket and workflow management.

The main focus of the site will be on using a AI assistant to help set up
workflows and tickets. Later, the AI assistant will also help with setting up and executing autonomous tasks as a part of workflows.

The initial target will be for small businesses to easily set up a ticket system.

This will be an MVP. I want to get it up and running quickly. The emphasis will not be on full features for the workflow management. The
main point will be to illustrate the capabilities of the AI assistant. We of course still want workable functionality.

The initial code we write will actual leave out the functionality of the AI assistant. We will be developing that. Here we will be 
building the ticket and workflow framework the AI assistant will fit into.

## Tech Stack

Back End:

- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- JWT
- Python with Type annotations
- Postgres
- Django's built-in TestCase

Front End:

- Typescript
- Vanilla React (including things like use reducer)
- Vite
- Tailwind and css modules
- Jest with React Testing Library

Docker/Server setup:

- Django running in docker (set up with docker compose)
    - Later we will use a hosted solution for postgres.
- Django server running on the PC used for initial development.
    - Later we will run this in docker
    - Later with AI assistant we will probably switch to a server like Uvicorn, Django Channels that will support websockets. 
- Vite set up on PC for development.
    - Later static files will be served from the server.
- Environment variables: .env file (with python-dotenv) for dev
    - Likely docker secrets for prod

Dev Machine:

- Windows PC
- VSCode (with debugger usage)

## Authorization and Security

- Strictly enforce a user from one company can not access any records labeled for a different company (eg ticket type or ticket instance)
    - Low priority on enforcing company id consistency between linked records (eg ticket type and ticket instance)
- System roles define access to different web site features, within a given company. They are global and we will use hard coded values for them.
- Company roles can be defined by the company to control access to specific ticket types for submission, which are of course defined by the company.

## User Management

- Company Sign-up Page
    - Fields: Company Name, Admin User Email, Admin User Password, Admin User First Name, Admin User Last Name
    - Function: Creates a new company and the first admin user
- User Login Page
    - Fields: Email, Password
- User Dashboard
    - Display user information
    - Links to other functionalities (Submit Tickets, My Tickets, etc.)
- Simple Profile Page (allows editing fields)
- Reset Password Page

For MVP, for starters, no functionality for creating additional company users. As a demo, users will be able to sign up as a company/person and do their own workflows and tickets. The full functionality will be built into the system apart from the UI part.

## User Ticket Pages

- Submit Tickets
- My Tickets
- Ticket Detail

Authorization note: "Company role" field is used for user access to ticket types.

## Ticket Team Pages

### Ticket Team: Admin

Access to all tickets (by company)

- Tickets (Active, Archive)
- Ticket Detail

- Tasks - (Active, Archive)
- Task Detail

We will support different options for assigning and tracking tickets, but for starters I think we will automatically give them to the available worker with the shortest list. Later we can think about giving options here. (Also, more advanced ticket tracking and analytics will be added later.)

### Ticket Team: Task Workers

- My Tasks (To execute)
- Task Execution (For manual/Form type tasks)

### Ticket Team: Workflow Designers

- Workflow Definitions
- Workflow Definition Detail
- Task Definitions
- Task Definition Detail
- Ticket Definitions
- Ticket Definition Detail

- Workflow Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Task Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Ticket Definition Upload (Create and edit)

We will have a detailed mechanism for creating workflows/tasks/tickets but for starters I want a minimal way to upload to those tables. (This would be  OK to be on the backend side. This is not an intended feature of the service.)
