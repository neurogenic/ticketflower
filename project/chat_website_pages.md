# Website Pages Chat 6/28/24

======================

I am working on a ticket and workflow management web site. I shared the schema below and also an outline of the web pages.

Could you review the pages and let me know if any changes or additions should be made?

```

## User Management

- Company Sign-up Page
    - Fields: Company Name, Admin User Email, Admin User Password, Admin User First Name, Admin User Last Name
    - Function: Creates a new company and the first admin user
- User Login Page
    - Fields: Email, Password
- User Dashboard
    - Display user information
    - Links to other functionalities (Submit Tickets, My Tickets, etc.)
- Simple Profile Page (allows editing fields)

NOTES: For MVP, no functionality for creating additional company users

## Authorization and Security

- Strictly enforce a user from one company can not access any records labeled for a different company (eg ticket type or ticket instance)
    - Low priority on enforcing company id consistency between linked records (eg ticket type and ticket instance)
- System roles define access to assets within a given company. They are global and we will use hard coded values for them: (We do still have a DB table for them.)
    - user
    - admin
    - ticket_admin
    - task_worker
    - workflow_creator
- Company specific roles can be defined to control access to ticket type submission. Default to companies having a role "user" and all users have this company role.

## User Pages

- Submit Tickets
- My Tickets
- Ticket Detail

Authorization note: "Company role" field is used for user access to ticket types.
TBD: Should this use the same control as the Admin list?

## Ticket Team Pages

### Ticket Team: Admin

Access to all tickets (by company)

- Tickets (Active, Archive)
- Ticket Detail

- Tasks - (Active, Archive)
- Task Detail

### Ticket Team: Task Workers

- My Tasks (To execute)
- Task Execution (For manual/Form type tasks)

TBD: Should we use the page or control from "Ticket Team: Admin" to access my tasks? This means we would need to add the link to open the task execution page too.

### Ticket Team: Workflow Designers

- Workflow Definitions
- Workflow Definition Detail
- Task Definitions
- Task Definition Detail
- Ticket Definitions
- Ticket Definition Detail

- Workflow Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Task Definition Upload (Create and edit)
- Ticket Definition Upload (Create and edit)

TBD: We will have a detailed mechanism for creating workflows/tasks/tickets but for starters I want a way to upload to those tables.

### Ticket Assignment

We will support different options for assigning and tracking tickets. For starters I think we will automatically give them to the available worker with the shortest list. Later we can think about giving options here. (Also, more advanced ticket tracking and analytics will be added later.)

I've reviewed the schema and the outline of web pages for your ticket and workflow management website. Here are some observations and suggestions for changes or additions:

====================================

# Review of Ticket and Workflow Management Website

## Schema Review

1. **Companies Table**: As noted, there's no reference to companies in the provided schema. This should be added to support multi-tenant functionality.

2. **User Table**: Not provided in the schema. This table should be added to store user information and link to the companies table.

3. **Roles**: Consider creating a separate roles table instead of hardcoding roles. This would allow for more flexible role management.

4. **File Uploads**: Good inclusion. Consider adding a reference to the related entity (ticket, task, etc.) to easily track which uploads belong where.

5. **Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.

6. **Soft Deletes**: Consider adding a `deleted_at` column to relevant tables for soft deletes.

## Page Structure Review

### User Management

- Add pages for user management:
  - User List
  - User Detail/Edit
  - Company List
  - Company Detail/Edit
  - Role Management

### User Pages

- Current structure looks good.
- Consider adding:
  - Dashboard/Overview page
  - Notifications page or component

### Ticket Team Pages

#### Admin

- Current structure is good.
- Add:
  - Dashboard with key metrics
  - Search functionality for tickets and tasks
  - Reporting and analytics page

#### Task Workers

- Current structure is good.
- Add:
  - Dashboard with personal performance metrics
  - Calendar view of upcoming tasks

#### Workflow Designers

- Current structure is good.
- Add:
  - Workflow visualization tool
  - Version control for workflows, tasks, and ticket definitions
  - Import/Export functionality for definitions

### Ticket Assignment

- Add a page or section for configuring assignment rules
- Include a view for manually assigning tickets/tasks

## General Suggestions

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a robust auth system, possibly using JWT tokens.

2. **API Documentation**: Create an API documentation page for potential integrations.

3. **Settings**: Add a global settings page for system-wide configurations.

4. **Audit Logs**: Implement a system for tracking changes to critical data.

5. **Notifications**: Add a notification system for important events (new tickets, task assignments, etc.).

6. **Search**: Implement a global search functionality across tickets, tasks, and workflows.

7. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all pages are mobile-friendly.

8. **Error Handling**: Create custom error pages and implement proper error logging.

9. **Performance Monitoring**: Add tools to monitor system performance and user activities.

10. **Data Export**: Allow admins to export data in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).

11. **Internationalization**: Prepare the system for multiple languages if needed.

12. **User Onboarding**: Create a guided tour or onboarding process for new users.

These suggestions aim to enhance the functionality, usability, and scalability of your ticket and workflow management system. Implementation priority should be based on your specific requirements and user needs.


I've provided a comprehensive review of your schema and page structure in the artifact above. This review includes suggestions for both the database schema and the website structure. Here are a few key points to highlight:

1. The addition of a Companies table and a more detailed Users table is crucial for proper user management and multi-tenancy support.

2. Consider expanding the user management pages to include company and role management.

3. For the Ticket Team pages, adding dashboards with relevant metrics for each role would be beneficial.

4. The Workflow Designers section could benefit from visual tools for workflow creation and management.

5. Consider adding more general features like a robust search functionality, audit logs, and a notification system to enhance the overall usability of the platform.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the review or discuss any particular aspect of the system in more detail?

=============================

Right now I'm thinking about the MVP so some of those features are intentionally excluded. The main features the mvp is highlighting is the assistance in creating tickets workflows and tasks from an AI agent. That part is excluded now because it's the part that's going to take the most development. What I'd like to do is get the basic workflow functionality working. For starters I want some minimal upload capability to populate workflow, task and ticket definitions. Then I'll be working on the AI assistant to create those separately.

With that mind I think the structure for most of those sections is good as is for the MVP. The two parts that need attention are the user management and the minimal workflow tasks take a definitions.

This will run just as a demo. What I'd like to do is have users sign up and when they sign up they'll create their own company. Maybe there should be a company sign up page where you create one user when you sign up for the company. At this point, for the sake of the demo, we won't even bother allowing for associating other users with a company but we can certainly add that later.

With these men will requirements for users what would you suggest for the user pages and the user and company tables.

===============================

I understand you're focusing on an MVP that highlights the AI-assisted creation of tickets, workflows, and tasks. For now, you want to set up the basic workflow functionality with minimal upload capabilities for definitions, while the AI assistant will be developed separately. Let's adjust our approach to fit these MVP requirements, particularly for user management and minimal workflow/task/ticket definition uploads.





# MVP Schema and Pages for Workflow Management System

## Updated Schema

```sql
-- Companies Table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'employee',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- (Other tables remain the same as in the original schema)
```

## Minimal User Pages

1. Company Sign-up Page
   - Fields: Company Name, Admin User Email, Admin User Password, Admin User First Name, Admin User Last Name
   - Function: Creates a new company and the first admin user

2. User Login Page
   - Fields: Email, Password

3. User Dashboard
   - Display user information
   - Links to other functionalities (Submit Tickets, My Tickets, etc.)

4. Simple Profile Page
   - Allow users to update their information

## Minimal Workflow Definition Pages

1. Workflow Definition Upload Page
   - Simple form to upload a JSON file containing workflow definitions
   - Basic validation of the JSON structure

2. Task Definition Upload Page
   - Simple form to upload a JSON file containing task definitions
   - Basic validation of the JSON structure

3. Ticket Definition Upload Page
   - Simple form to upload a JSON file containing ticket definitions
   - Basic validation of the JSON structure

4. Definition List Pages
   - Simple pages to list uploaded definitions (separate for workflows, tasks, and tickets)
   - Include basic details and option to view full JSON

## User Flow

1. A new company signs up through the Company Sign-up Page, creating the company and admin user.
2. The admin user logs in through the User Login Page.
3. From the User Dashboard, the admin can access the upload pages for workflow, task, and ticket definitions.
4. The admin can view the uploaded definitions through the list pages.
5. Regular users can sign up (if you decide to add this functionality) or be created by the admin.
6. Regular users can log in and access permitted functionalities from their dashboard.

This structure provides a minimal viable product that allows for company creation, user management, and the upload of workflow, task, and ticket definitions. It sets the stage for future development of the AI-assisted creation features.


Based on your MVP requirements, I've created an artifact that outlines an updated schema for users and companies, along with a minimal set of user pages and workflow definition pages. Here are the key points:

1. The schema now includes a simple Companies table and an updated Users table that references the company.

2. User management is simplified to a Company Sign-up page that creates both the company and the first admin user.

3. I've outlined minimal pages for user login, dashboard, and profile management.

4. For workflow, task, and ticket definitions, I've suggested simple upload pages that accept JSON files. This allows you to populate these definitions easily for your MVP.

5. Basic list pages for viewing the uploaded definitions are included.

This structure should provide a solid foundation for your MVP, allowing you to demonstrate the basic workflow functionality while setting the stage for the AI-assisted features you'll develop later.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this MVP structure? Or perhaps you'd like to discuss how to prepare this foundation for the future AI integration?

==================================

I think we are getting too much proliferation. I am thinking about doing this:

```sql
-- Companies Table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User Roles (Junction Table)
CREATE TABLE user_system_roles (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role_name  VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_name)
);

-- User Roles (Junction Table)
CREATE TABLE user_company_roles (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role_name  VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_name)
);

-- System Roles - fixed by system (We will use hard coded roles in code for now.)
CREATE TABLE system_roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(100),
);

-- Company Roles - Managed by company, used for ticket submit permissions
CREATE TABLE user_company_roles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES company(id),
    role_name VARCHAR(100),
    description VARCHAR(255)
);
```

All roles are set by string value. System roles are fixed (for now). Company roles are settable. In the future we can add management tools to make sure invalid role names aren't sitting around. But if they are then that is just an inconvenience and not a security threat.
