# TicketFlower: Ticketing and Workflow System

## 1. System Overview

TicketFlower is a flexible ticketing and workflow management system designed to handle various business processes, from enterprise service requests to customer order processing. Its key features include easy ticket submission, customizable workflows, and AI-assisted setup.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Ticket Submission
- Web form interface for manual submission
- REST API for programmatic submission
- AI-assisted form creation for easy setup

### 2.2 Ticket Repository
- Central database for storing all ticket information
- Includes both standard and custom ticket data
- Tracks ticket status and workflow progress

### 2.3 Workflow Engine
- Manages the progression of tickets through predefined steps
- Supports both manual and automated actions
- AI-assisted workflow creation

### 2.4 Assignment System
- Manages the distribution of tasks to workers
- Supports multiple assignment strategies (manual, automated, dispatched)

### 2.5 Action Execution
- Web forms for manual task completion
- API endpoints for automated task execution
- Supports future integration of autonomous workers

### 2.6 Reporting and Analytics
- Provides insights on system usage, ticket resolution times, and workflow efficiency

## 3. Detailed System Flow

### 3.1 Ticket Creation
1. User submits ticket via web form or API
2. System validates and processes the submission
3. Ticket is stored in the repository with initial "Pending Assignment" status
4. Workflow is associated with the ticket based on predefined rules

### 3.2 Ticket Assignment
1. New tickets appear in the "Ticket Repository" dashboard
2. Assignment occurs through one of the following methods:
   a. Manual selection by available workers
   b. Automated assignment based on predefined rules
   c. Manual assignment by a dispatcher
3. Ticket status is updated to "Assigned"

### 3.3 Action Execution
1. Assigned worker receives notification of new task
2. Worker accesses task details and required action (web form or API call)
3. Worker completes the action and submits results
4. System validates the submission

### 3.4 Workflow Progression
1. System updates ticket status based on action completion
2. If more steps remain in the workflow:
   a. Ticket returns to "Pending Assignment" state
   b. Process repeats from step 3.2
3. If workflow is complete, ticket is marked as "Closed"

## 4. MVP Features

### 4.1 Ticket Submission
- Web form for manual ticket creation
- Basic validation of submitted data

### 4.2 Ticket Repository
- Single list view of all open tickets
- Basic sorting and filtering options (e.g., by date, status)

### 4.3 Workflow Management
- Support for linear workflows (sequential steps)
- Manual action execution via web forms
- Basic API support for automated actions

### 4.4 Assignment
- Manual selection of tickets by workers from the repository view

### 4.5 Reporting
- Simple view of completed actions and closed tickets

## 5. Future Enhancements

### 5.1 Advanced Ticket Submission
- Multi-step submission forms
- File attachment support
- Ticket templates for common requests

### 5.2 Workflow Enhancements
- Support for complex, branching workflows
- Conditional logic within workflows
- SLA and deadline tracking

### 5.3 Assignment Improvements
- Skill-based routing
- Load balancing algorithms
- Integration with existing HRMS for worker management

### 5.4 Automation
- AI-powered ticket classification and prioritization
- Automated resolution for common issues
- Integration with RPA tools for complex automated actions

### 5.5 Reporting and Analytics
- Advanced dashboards with real-time metrics
- Predictive analytics for resource planning
- Custom report generation

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Architecture
- Microservices architecture for scalability and modularity
- Event-driven design for real-time updates and integrations

### 6.2 Data Storage
- Relational database for structured ticket and workflow data
- NoSQL database for flexible custom fields and unstructured data

### 6.3 Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging for all system actions

### 6.4 Integration
- RESTful APIs for all core functionalities
- Webhook support for real-time notifications
- Support for standard SSO protocols (e.g., SAML, OAuth)

### 6.5 AI Integration
- Natural Language Processing for ticket classification and routing
- Machine Learning models for predicting ticket resolution times and resource needs

## 7. Implementation Strategy

1. Develop core MVP features
2. Conduct limited beta testing with a small group of users
3. Gather feedback and iterate on the MVP
4. Gradually introduce additional features based on user needs and technical feasibility
5. Continuously refine AI-assisted setup process for forms and workflows

This outline provides a structured approach to developing the TicketFlower system, starting with a viable MVP and outlining potential future enhancements. The focus on simplicity and AI-assisted setup aligns well with the goal of creating a user-friendly and adaptable ticketing and workflow solution.
